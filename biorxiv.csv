Parallel ecological and evolutionary responses to selection in a natural bacterial community,"Evolution can occur over ecological timescales, suggesting a potentially important role for rapid evolution in shaping community trait distributions. However, evidence of concordant eco-evolutionary dynamics often comes from in vitro studies of highly simplified communities, and measures of ecological and evolutionary dynamics are rarely directly comparable. Here, we quantified how ecological species sorting and rapid evolution simultaneously shape community trait distributions by tracking within and between-species changes in a key trait in a complex bacterial community. We focused on the production of siderophores; bacteria use these costly secreted metabolites to scavenge poorly soluble iron and to detoxify environments polluted with toxic non-ferrous metals. We found that responses to copper-imposed selection within and between species were ultimately the same - intermediate siderophore levels were favored - and occurred over similar timescales. Despite being a social trait, this level of siderophore production was selected regardless of whether species evolved in isolation or in a community context. Our study suggests that evolutionary selection can play a pivotal role in shaping community trait distributions within natural, highly complex, bacterial communities. Furthermore, trait evolution may not always be qualitatively affected by interactions with other community members.

SignificanceBacterial communities possess remarkable taxonomic and metabolic diversity and play a key role in nearly every biogeochemical process on Earth. Rapid evolution (occurring over ecological time scales) can in principle shape these processes, yet we have little understanding of its importance in natural communities. Here, we quantified how the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores is driven by species compositional changes and evolution in a compost community in response to copper stress. We found that siderophore production converged at intermediate levels, with evolutionary and ecological changes occurring at similar rates. Understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes contribute to shaping trait distributions will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to global change, and aid in the engineering of microbial consortia.","['bacterial', 'ecological', 'evolutionary', 'selection', 'natural', 'biogeochemical', 'significancebacterial', 'bacteria', 'bacterial', 'evolutionary', 'evolutionary biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Co-infection with Toxoplasma gondii leads to a loss of resistance in Heligmosomoides bakeri trickle-infected mice due to ineffective granulomas,"The intestinal roundworm Heligmosomoides bakeri causes chronic infection in susceptible (C57Bl/6) mice; however, repeat (trickle) infection confers immunity and facilitates worm clearance. We previously showed that this acquired immunity is associated with a strong Th2 response, notably the enhanced production of intestinal granulomas. Here we demonstrate that elevated proportions of IgG1-bound eosinophils and macrophages are observed around the developing tissue worms of trickle-infected female C57Bl/6 mice compared to bolus infected animals. Levels of IgG2c, IgA or IgE were not detected in the granulomas. Increased proportions of SiglecF+ and CD206+ cells, but not Ly6G+ and/or NK1.1+ cells, were also found in the granulomas of trickle-infected mice. However, in the natural world rather than the laboratory setting, immune environments are more nuanced. We examined the impact of a mixed immune environment on trickle infection-induced immunity, using a pre-infection with Toxoplasma gondii. The mixed immune environment resulted in fewer and smaller granulomas with a lack of IgG1-bound cells as well as reduced proportions of SiglecF+ and CD206+ cells, measured by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. This was associated with a higher worm burden in the co-infected animals. Our data confirm the importance of intestinal granulomas and parasite-specific antibody for parasite clearance. They highlight why it may be more difficult to clear worms in the field than in the laboratory.","['mice', 'toxoplasma', 'infection', 'infected', 'ineffective', 'immunofluorescence', 'intestinal', 'mice', 'roundworm', 'worms', 'immunology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by,
The molecular infrastructure of glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian forebrain,"Glutamatergic synapses form the vast majority of connections within neuronal circuits, but how these subcellular structures are molecularly organized within the mammalian brain is poorly understood. Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the  postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a high density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a  synaptoplasm consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of 4-60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft. Together, these information-rich tomographic maps present a detailed molecular framework for the coordinated activity of synapses in the adult mammalian brain.","['mammalian', 'glutamatergic', 'molecular', 'forebrain', 'synapses', 'mouse', 'mammalian', 'proteinaceous', 'genetics', 'molecular', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Selective attention and decision-making have separable neural bases in space and time,"Attention and decision-making processes are fundamental to cognition. However, they are usually experimentally confounded, making it difficult to link neural observations to specific processes. Here we separated the effects of selective attention from the effects of decision-making on human brain activity, using a two-stage task where the attended stimulus and decision were orthogonal and separated in time. Multivariate pattern analyses of multimodal neuroimaging data revealed the dynamics of perceptual and decision-related information coding through time (magnetoencephalography (MEG)), space (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)), and their combination (MEG-fMRI fusion). Our MEG results showed an effect of attention before decision-making could begin, and fMRI results showed an attention effect in early visual and frontoparietal regions. Model-based MEG-fMRI fusion suggested that attention boosted stimulus information in frontoparietal and early visual regions before decision-making was possible. Together, our results suggest that attention affects neural stimulus representations in frontoparietal regions independent of decision-making.","['neural', 'space', 'separable', 'attention', 'selective', 'neuroimaging', 'magnetoencephalography', 'neural', 'brain', 'fmri', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Beyond Prior and Volatility: The Distinct Iterative Prior Account in ASD,"The nature of predictive-processing differences between individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) individuals is widely debated. Some studies suggest impairments in predictive processing in ASD, while others report intact processes, albeit with atypical learning dynamics. Here, we assessed duration reproduction tasks in high- and low-volatility settings to examine the updating dynamics of prior beliefs and sensory estimates. Employing a two-state Bayesian model, we differentiated how individuals with ASD and TD controls update their priors and perceptual estimates, and how these updates affect long-term prediction and behavior. Our findings indicate that individuals with ASD use prior knowledge and sensory input similarly to TD controls in perceptual estimates. However, they place a greater weight on sensory inputs specifically for iteratively updating their priors. This distinct approach to prior updating led to slower adaptation across trials; individuals with ASD relied less on their priors in perceptual estimates during the first half of sessions but achieved comparable integration weights as TD controls by the end of the session. By differentiating these aspects, our study highlights the importance of considering inter-trial updating dynamics to reconcile diverse findings of predictive processing in ASD. In consequence to the current findings, we suggest the distinct iterative updating account of predictive processing in ASD.","['iterative', 'volatility', 'asd', 'distinct', 'account', 'autism', 'iterative', 'disorder', 'updating', 'differentiating', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
Prophages divert Staphylococcus aureus defenses against host lipids,"Phages are ubiquitous in bacteria, including clinical Staphylococcus aureus, where Sfi 21/Sa3 phages often integrate into the hlb gene, encoding Hlb sphingomyelinase. The integration acts as a rapid regulatory switch of Hlb production. Our findings suggest that Sfi 21/Sa3 prophages and Hlb activity affect S. aureus fitness by modulating the incorporation of the toxic linoleic acid (C18:2) from serum into the bacterial membrane. This process relies on C18:2 derived from 1,3-diglyceride, facilitated by the FakB1 kinase subunit. Palmitic acid (C16), primarily released from serum through Hlb activity, competes for FakB1. This mechanism contributes to adaptation to AFN-1252, an antibiotic inhibiting the fatty acid synthesis pathway (anti-FASII). Since S. aureus relies on exogenous fatty acids for growth, AFN-1252 treatment leads to increased proportion of membrane C18:2. Moreover, Hlb inhibition, whether via prophage insertion, gene inactivation, or enzyme inhibition, delays S. aureus adaptation, resulting in higher proportionof C18:2 in the membrane. This study sheds light on the role of lipid environments in infections, and may contribute to the accurate prediction of infection risks and therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, given that both anti-FASII and Hlb inhibitors enhance C18:2 incorporation, they represent potential agents for combined strategies against S. aureus.","['staphylococcus', 'lipids', 'aureus', 'prophages', 'defenses', 'staphylococcus', 'sphingomyelinase', 'bacterial', 'bacteria', 'antibiotic', 'microbiology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Cyclin CLB2 mRNA localization and protein synthesis link cell cycle progression to bud growth,"Clb2 is a conserved mitotic B-type cyclin, the levels of which are finely controlled to drive progression through the cell cycle. While it is known that CLB2 transcription and Clb2 protein degradation are important for precise control of its expression, it remains unclear whether the synthesis of Clb2 is also regulated. To address whether and how Clb2 expression levels respond to cell growth changes and adapt cell cycle progression, we combined single-cell and single-molecule imaging methods to measure CLB2 mRNA and protein expression throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. We found that the CLB2 mRNA was efficiently localized to the yeast bud as soon as this compartment was formed, but strikingly the Clb2 protein accumulated in the mother nucleus. The CLB2 mRNA localization in the yeast bud by the She2-3 complex did not control protein localization but rather promoted CLB2 translation. Moreover, CLB2 mRNA bud localization and protein synthesis were coupled and dependent on a single secondary structure -a ZIP code-located in the coding sequence. In a CLB2 ZIP code mutant, mRNA localization was impaired and Clb2 protein synthesis decreased, resulting in changes in cell cycle distribution and increased size of daughter cells at birth. Finally, while in WT cells the Clb2 protein concentration followed bud growth, this relationship was impaired in the ZIP code mutant. We propose that S. cerevisiae couples the control of CLB2 mRNA bud localization and protein synthesis to coordinate cell growth and cell cycle progression. This mechanism extends our knowledge of CLB2 expression regulation, and constitutes a novel function for mRNA localization.","['mrna', 'synthesis', 'protein', 'clb2', 'cell', 'mitotic', 'mrna', 'protein', 'transcription', 'synthesis', 'molecular biology']",,2024-06-23,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Reproducibility of in-vivo electrophysiological measurements in mice,"Understanding brain function relies on the collective work of many labs generating reproducible results. However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","['mice', 'electrophysiological', 'vivo', 'measurements', 'reproducibility', 'neuroscience', 'neuropixels', 'mice', 'labs', 'lab', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Noisy circumnutations facilitate self-organized shade avoidance in sunflowers,"Circumnutations are widespread in plants and typically associated with exploratory movements, however a quantitative understanding of their role remains elusive. In this study we report, for the first time, the role of noisy circumnutations in facilitating an optimal growth pattern within a crowded group of mutually shading plants. We revisit the problem of self-organization observed for sunflowers, mediated by shade response interactions. Our analysis reveals that circumnutation movements conform to a bounded random walk characterized by a remarkably broad distribution of velocities, covering three orders of magnitude. In motile animal systems such wide distributions of movement velocities are frequently identified with enhancement of behavioral processes, suggesting that circumnutations may serve as a source of functional noise. To test our hypothesis, we developed a Langevin-type parsimonious model of interacting growing disks, informed by experiments, successfully capturing the characteristic dynamics of individual and multiple interacting plants. Employing our simulation framework we examine the role of circumnutations in the system, and find that the observed breadth of the velocity distribution represents a sharp transition in the force-noise ratio, conferring advantageous effects by facilitating exploration of potential configurations, leading to an optimized arrangement with minimal shading. These findings represent the first report of functional noise in plant movements, and establishes a theoretical foundation for investigating how plants navigate their environment by employing computational processes such as task-oriented processes, optimization, and active sensing. Since plants move by growing, space and time are coupled, and dynamics of self-organization lead to emergent 3D patterns. As such this system provides conceptual insight for other interacting growth-driven systems such fungal hyphae, neurons and self-growing robots, as well as active matter systems where agents interact with past trajectories of their counterparts, such as stigmergy in social insects. This foundational insight has implications in statistical physics, ecological dynamics, agriculture, and even swarm robotics.

Ancient midbrain inhibitory neurons control selective spatial attention,"To behave adaptively in complex environments, animals must selectively process the most important information in space while ignoring distractors. Contrary to the dominant cortico-centric view, we report that an evolutionarily old group of inhibitory neurons in the brainstem, called PLTi, is critical for this function of selective spatial attention. In freely behaving mice performing a human-like spatial attention task, we found that bilateral silencing of PLTi severely disrupted target selection without causing perceptual or motor impairments. PLTis effects depended necessarily on goal-relevant, rather than just physical salience-based signals, together revealing it as a dedicated brain site for priority-driven attentional target selection. PLTis core computational function is its explicit implementation of the abstract cognitive decision boundary separating target from distracters: it controlled the accuracy and categorical precision of this decision boundary, doing so by shaping neural representations of competing stimuli in the superior colliculus, a major sensorimotor hub. PLTi may, therefore, be a conserved brainstem engine across vertebrates for winner-take-all-like spatial decisions in goal-driven behavior.","['neurons', 'ancient', 'midbrain', 'inhibitory', 'selective', 'brainstem', 'mice', 'cognitive', 'inhibitory', 'neural', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Widespread of horizontal gene transfer events in eukaryotes,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genetic material between distantly related organisms. While most genes in prokaryotes can be horizontally transferred, HGT events in eukaryotes are considered as rare, particularly in mammals. Here we reported the identification of HGT regions (HGTs), which are genomic sequence fragments indicating the occurrence of HGT events, in human, mouse, cow, lizard, frog, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, Arabidopsis and yeast. By comparing the genomes of these 10 representative eukaryotes with 1,496 eukaryotic genomes, 16,098 bacteria and 11,695 viruses, we found between 10 and 243 non-redundant HGTs per species, and most of these HGTs were previously unknown. These HGTs have transformed their host genomes with various numbers of copies and have impacted hundreds, even thousands of genes. We listed several examples of HGTs and proposed some possible routes that HGT events occurred. Further analysis showed that the majority of the 1,496 eukaryotes with full length genome sequences also contain HGTs. Our findings reveal that HGT is widespread in eukaryotic genomes, and HGT is a ubiquitous driver of genome evolution for eukaryotes.","['eukaryotes', 'gene', 'widespread', 'horizontal', 'transfer', 'genomic', 'genetic', 'genes', 'prokaryotes', 'eukaryotes', 'genomics']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Precise control of neural activity using dynamically optimized electrical stimulation,"Neural implants have the potential to restore lost sensory function by electrically evoking the complex naturalistic activity patterns of neural populations. However, it can be difficult to predict and control evoked neural responses to simultaneous multi-electrode stimulation due to nonlinearity of the responses. We present a solution to this problem and demonstrate its utility in the context of a bi-directional retinal implant for restoring vision. A dynamically optimized stimulation approach encodes incoming visual stimuli into a rapid, greedily chosen, temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed sequence of simple stimulation patterns. Stimuli are selected to optimize the reconstruction of the visual stimulus from the evoked responses. Temporal dithering exploits the slow time scales of downstream neural processing, and spatial multiplexing exploits the independence of responses generated by distant electrodes. The approach was evaluated using an experimental laboratory prototype of a retinal implant: large-scale, high-resolution multi-electrode stimulation and recording of macaque and rat retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. The dynamically optimized stimulation approach substantially enhanced performance compared to existing approaches based on static mapping between visual stimulus intensity and current amplitude. The modular framework enabled parallel extensions to naturalistic viewing conditions, incorporation of perceptual similarity measures, and efficient implementation for an implantable device. A direct closed-loop test of the approach supported its potential use in vision restoration.

Neuregulin1 nuclear signaling influences adult neurogenesis and regulates a schizophrenia susceptibility gene network within the mouse dentate gyrus.,"Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling is critical for aspects of neuronal development and function from fate specification to synaptic plasticity. Type III Nrg1 is a synaptic protein which engages in bi-directional signaling with its receptor ErbB4. Forward signaling engages ErbB4 phosphorylation, whereas back signaling engages two known mechanisms: 1. local axonal PI3K-AKT signaling, and 2. cleavage by gamma secretase resulting in cytosolic release of the intracellular domain (ICD), which can traffic to the nucleus (Bao, Wolpowitz et al. 2003, Hancock, Canetta et al. 2008). To dissect the contribution of these alternate signaling strategies to neuronal development we generated a transgenic mouse with a missense mutation (V321L) in the Nrg1 transmembrane domain that disrupts nuclear back signaling with minimal effects on forward signaling or local back-signaling and was previously found to be associated with psychosis (Walss-Bass, Liu et al. 2006). We combined RNA sequencing, retroviral fate mapping of neural stem cells, behavioral analyses, and various network analyses of transcriptomic data to investigate the effect of disrupting Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female mice.

The V321L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD and alters gene expression in the DG. V321L mice show reduced stem cell proliferation, altered cell cycle dynamics, fate specification defects, and dendritic dysmorphogenesis. Orthologs of known schizophrenia (SCZ)-susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the V321L DG. These genes coordinated a larger network with other dysregulated genes. WGCNA and protein-interaction network analyses revealed striking similarity between DG transcriptomes of V321L mouse and humans with schizophrenia.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSynaptic contact is predicted to be a regulator of the generation of nuclear signaling by Nrg1. Here we show that a schizophrenia-associated mutation in Nrg1 disrupts its ability to communicate extracellular signals to the neuronal genome which results in altered expression of a gene network enriched for orthologs of schizophrenia-susceptibility genes. The striking overlap in functional and molecular alterations between a single rare homozygous missense mutation (V321L) and schizophrenia patient data (complex polygenic and environmental burden) underscores potential convergence of rare and common variants on the same cellular and molecular phenotypes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the evolutionarily conserved gene networks that form the basis for this risk are necessary for coordinating neurodevelopmental events in the DG.","['neuregulin1', 'neurogenesis', 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'mouse', 'neuregulin1', 'neurodevelopmental', 'transmembrane', 'transcriptomes', 'transcriptomic', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc0,
Nonlinear computation by a habenula-driven recurrent inhibitory network in the raphe,"Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a constellation of long-range inputs, yet guiding principles of local circuit organization and underlying computations in this nucleus are largely unknown. Using inputs from the lateral habenula (LHb) to interrogate the processing features of the DRN, we uncovered 5-HT1A receptor-mediated recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition. Cellular electrophysiology and imaging of a genetically encoded 5-HT sensor revealed that these recurrent inhibitory connections spanned the raphe, were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating, and gated spike output. These features collectively conveyed highly non-linear dynamics to this network, generating excitation-driven inhibition and winner-take-all computations. In vivo optogenetic activation of LHb inputs to DRN, at frequencies where these computations are predicted to ignite, transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task. Together, these data identify a core computation supported by an unsuspected slow serotonergic recurrent inhibitory network.","['nonlinear', 'inhibitory', 'computation', 'raphe', 'driven', 'electrophysiology', 'neurons', 'serotonergic', 'serotonin', 'receptor', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_no,
The m6A reader IGF2BP2 directs immune-metabolic reprogramming in Leishmania amazonensis-infected macrophages,"Macrophages are the major host cells of the protozoan parasite Leishmania in mammalian infection. These key innate immune cells display remarkable phenotypic plasticity ranging from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that can control infection and tissue homeostasis, respectively. It has been recognized that Leishmania exploits macrophage phenotypic plasticity to establish chronic infection. However, the current notion that these parasites simply trigger an M2-like phenotype seems over-simplified considering the immunopathology observed during leishmaniasis - in particular in response to Leishmania amazonensis - which is often characterized by a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. Here we combined a series of systems-level analyses to shed new light on the phenotype of Leishmania-infected macrophages (LIMs) during short- and long-term infection, in vitro and in vivo. Immuno-metabolic profiling by RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, cytokine immunoassays, and real-time bioenergetic flux analysis of L. amazonensis-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) revealed a highly complex and unique phenotypic and bioenergetic signature. In vitro LIMs were characterized by co-expression of both M1 and M2 markers at RNA and protein levels and increased expression of glycolytic genes that matched a progressive metabolic switch from a M2-like respiratory to a M1-like glycolytic energy production observed for both long-term in vitro and in vivo infected macrophages. Unlike in M1 macrophages, glycolytic gene expression did not correlate with increased expression of its key regulatory HIF-1. In contrast, siRNA knock down experiments in primary BMDMs uncovered an essential role of the m6A reader protein IGF2BP2 in stabilizing m6A modified transcripts of the glycolytic pathway, contributing to HIF-1-independent induction of glycolysis. In conclusion, L. amazonensis establishes a complex and unique phenotypic shift in infected macrophages in vitro and in vivo that combines M1-like and M2-like immuno-metabolomic characteristics and implicates differential mRNA stability in induction of aerobic glycolysis. Our data thus uncover epi-transcriptomic regulation as a novel target for Leishmania immune subversion to establish a host cell phenotype beneficial for intracellular parasite development and chronic infection.","['igf2bp2', 'amazonensis', 'reprogramming', 'macrophages', 'm6a', 'immunopathology', 'igf2bp2', 'bioenergetic', 'immunoassays', 'transcriptomic', 'immunology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
A method to adjust for the uncertainty of predicted expression in transcriptome-wide association study,"1Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a promising approach to identifying novel genes associated with complex phenotypes. It offers better biological insights into the gene-phenotype associations than a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Standard TWAS approaches build a prediction model for the genetic component of expression based on reference transcriptome data. Next, an outcome phenotype is regressed on the predicted expression in separate GWAS data. The traditional unadjusted TWAS approach ignores the uncertainty of predicted expression, which can lead to unreliable discovery of gene-phenotype associations. We propose a novel approach to adjust for the uncertainty of predicted expression in TWAS. We adapt techniques from measurement error theory and implement bootstrapping algorithms for penalized regression to obtain an adjustment factor that needs to be incorporated in the unadjusted TWAS. We use extensive simulations to show that the unadjusted TWAS severely inflates the type 1 error rate, whereas the adjusted TWAS adequately controls it. At the expense of an alarmingly inflated false positive rate, the unadjusted TWAS offers a higher power than the adjusted TWAS, which is statistically unjustified. We demonstrate the merits of adjusted TWAS by conducting TWAS for height and lipid phenotypes while integrating the Geuvadis transcriptome and UK Biobank GWAS data.","['transcriptome', 'study', 'predicted', 'adjust', 'association', 'genetic', 'algorithms', 'genes', 'biobank', 'genome', 'genomics']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
The chloroplast ATP synthase redox domain in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii attenuates activity regulation as requirement for heterotrophic metabolism in darkness.,"To maintain CO2 fixation in the Calvin Benson-Bassham cycle, multi-step regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1Fo) is crucial to balance the ATP output of photosynthesis with protection of the apparatus. A well-studied mechanism is thiol modulation; a light/dark regulation through reversible cleavage of a disulfide in the CF1Fo {gamma}-subunit. The disulfide hampers ATP synthesis and hydrolysis reactions in dark-adapted CF1Fo from land plants by increasing the required transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient [Formula]. Here, we show in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that algal CF1Fo is differently regulated in vivo. A specific hairpin structure in the {gamma}-subunit redox domain disconnects activity regulation from disulfide formation in the dark. Electrochromic shift measurements suggested that the hairpin kept wild type CF1Fo active whereas the enzyme was switched off in algal mutant cells expressing a plant-like hairpin structure. The hairpin segment swap resulted in an elevated [Formula] threshold to activate plant-like CF1Fo, increased by [~]1.4 photosystem (PS) I charge separations. The resulting dark-equilibrated [Formula] dropped in the mutants by [~]2.7 PSI charge separation equivalents. Photobioreactor experiments showed no phenotypes in autotrophic aerated mutant cultures. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements under heterotrophic dark conditions point to a reduced plastoquinone pool in cells with the plant-like CF1Fo as the result of bioenergetic bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the lifestyle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii requires a specific CF1Fo dark regulation that partakes in metabolic coupling between the chloroplast and acetate-fueled mitochondria.

Significance StatementThe microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits a non-classical thiol modulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase for the sake of metabolic flexibility. The redox switch, although established, was functionally disconnected in vivo thanks to a hairpin segment in the {gamma}-subunit redox domain. Dark enzymatic activity was prevented by replacing the algal hairpin segment with the one from land plants, restoring a classical thiol modulation pattern. Thereby, ATP was saved at the expense of thylakoid membrane energization levels in the dark. However, metabolism was impaired upon silencing dark ATPase activity, indicating that a functional disconnect from the redox switch represents an adaptation to different ecological niches.","['synthase', 'chloroplast', 'atp', 'redox', 'reinhardtii', 'atpase', 'bioenergetic', 'atp', 'electrochromic', 'photosynthesis', 'plant biology']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
Never let me down: new possibilities for lowering serum free cultivation media costs,"Cultivated meat may be a more ethical, environmentally friendly, antibiotic-free meat alternative of the future. As of now, one of the main limiting factors for bringing cultivated meat to the market is the high cost of the cell culture media and their great dependency on serum albumins, production of which is predicted to become a major bottleneck of this industry. Here, using bovine muscle stem cells (BSC) we optimized B8/B9 medium - one of the well-established serum free, fully defined medium compositions available for purchase or for preparation in-house. We show several combinations of the growth factors/myokines/hormones, which were able to substantially increase BSCs proliferation rate, as well as treatment schemes allowing for five to ten times lower concentrations of signaling molecules for the same effect. Additionally, we identified several food grade, low-price medium stabilizers, exhibiting comparable or even superior stabilization of the B8 medium in short-term cultivations, as compared to recombinant human serum albumin (HSA). DoE aided in identifying the best cultivation conditions. Other satellite cells (porcine, chicken and fish) were grown in several final cell culture medium compositions, showing significant cell-line specific differences in performance. Also, the proliferation and yield of CHO cell line, which is relevant e.g. for the production of growth factors, was also successfully increased using our stabilization approach. We conclude that stabilizers tested here can act as versatile low-cost medium additives, partly by prolonging the half-life of growth factors. Thus, we provide an alternative to HSA, enabling an overall 73% reduction of medium price.","['serum', 'cultivation', 'free', 'lowering', 'possibilities', 'antibiotic', 'meat', 'food', 'chicken', 'fish', 'cell biology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Cerebral organoids expressing mutant actin genes reveal cellular mechanism underlying microcephalic cortical malformation,"Actins are structural cytoskeletal proteins playing crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Mutations in the ACTB and ACTG1 genes, encoding the ubiquitous beta- and gamma- cytoskeletal actin isoforms, respectively, cause a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, with microcephaly as the most frequent one. Here we used patient-derived cerebral organoids to gain insight into the pathogenesis underlying this cortical malformation. Cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with the Baraitser-Winter- CerebroFrontoFacial syndrome (BWCFF-S), expressing either an ACTB or an ACTG1 missense mutation, are reduced in size, showing a thinner ventricular zone (VZ). This decrease in VZ progenitors is in turn associated with a striking change in the orientation of their cleavage plane from predominantly vertical (control) to predominantly horizontal (BWCFF-S), which is incompatible with increasing VZ progenitor abundance. Various cytoskeletal and morphological irregularities of BWCFF-S VZ progenitors, notably in the apical region of these cells, seemingly contribute to their predominantly horizontal cleavage plane orientation. Our results provide insight into the cell biological basis of the microcephaly associated with BWCFF-S caused by actin mutations.","['genes', 'organoids', 'mutant', 'cerebral', 'cellular', 'neurodevelopmental', 'genes', 'pathogenesis', 'cerebrofrontofacial', 'proteins', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Why the brown ghost chirps at night,"Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo, and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is one of the most widely studied species due to its rich electric vocabulary, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment emitted continuously by their electric organ and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown.

This study re-evaluates this view, aiming to offer an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.","['chirps', 'ghost', 'night', 'brown', 'knifefish', 'fish', 'neuroethology', 'freshwater', 'valuable', 'animal behavior and cognition']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
A distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuit governs risk preference,"Appropriate risk evaluation is essential for survival in complex, uncertain environments. Confronted with choosing between certain (safe) and uncertain (risky) options, animals show strong preference for either option consistently across extended time periods. How such risk preference is encoded in the brain remains elusive. A candidate region is the lateral habenula (LHb), which is prominently involved in value-guided behavior. Here, using a balanced two-alternative choice task and longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging, we identify LHb neurons with risk-preference-selective activity reflecting individual risk preference prior to action selection. By employing whole-brain anatomical tracing, multi-fiber photometry, and projection- and cell-type-specific optogenetics, we find that glutamatergic LHb projections from the medial (MH) but not lateral (LH) hypothalamus provide behavior-relevant synaptic input before action selection. Optogenetic stimulation of MH{lozenge}LHb axons evoked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses, whereas LH{lozenge}LHb projections were excitatory. We thus reveal functionally distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuits for risk preference in habitual economic decision-making.","['hypothalamus', 'habenula', 'preference', 'risk', 'circuit', 'optogenetics', 'optogenetic', 'glutamatergic', 'essential', 'photometry', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Non-senescent species are not immortal: stress and decline in two planaria species,"1. Potential immortality is observed in several species (e.g., prickly pear cactus, hydra, flatworms) and is indicative of their negligible or even negative senescence rates. Unlike in senescent species, which experience reduced individual performance with age due to physiological degradation, species with negligible or negative senescence display mortality rates that remain constant or decline with age, respectively. These rates vary across taxa and are correlated with life history traits. Yet, the extent to which variable resource availability, a key driver of variation in life history traits, impacts species that show negligible or negative senescence is currently unknown.

2. Here, we examine whether and how variation in the quantity, quality, and feeding interval of resources impact population structure, population performance, and life history trait trade-offs in two long-lived planaria that do not senesce: Schmidtea mediterranea and Dugesia tahitiensis. In a full factorial design, different combinations of resource quantity (reduced intake, standard intake and high intake) and quality (high and low quality) were provided in two different feeding intervals (7-day and 14-day intervals) for 19 weeks.

3. We show that variability in resource availability, via decreases in quantity, quality, and frequency of resources, does not diminish population viability in either species but does result in suboptimal conditions of stress in S. mediterranea.

4. The high population viability we report can be attributed to two different mechanisms: increased reproduction or increased investment into maintenance at the expense of reproduction. Moreover, which mechanism was responsible for said high population viability was context-dependent and modulated by the specific life history strategy of the two planaria species.

5. We show that suboptimal conditions can cause stress responses that have significant impacts on non-senescent species. The context-dependent response we observe suggests that species that do not senesce but are subject to suboptimal conditions of stress may ultimately exhibit declines in performance and ultimately die. A clearer understanding of the impact of suboptimal conditions of resource availability on non-senescent species is needed to determine the extent of stress experienced and ultimately whether a species can truly be immortal.","['decline', 'stress', 'non', 'senescent', 'immortal', 'cactus', 'immortality', 'flatworms', 'diminish', 'mortality', 'ecology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
Sustainability of seed harvesting in wild plant populations: an insight from a global database of matrix population models,"Seed harvesting from wild plant populations is key for ecological restoration, but may threaten the persistence of source populations. Consequently, several countries have set guidelines limiting the proportions of harvestable seeds. However, these guidelines are so far inconsistent, and they lack a solid empirical basis. Here, we use high-resolution data from 298 plant species to model the demographic consequences of seed harvesting. We find that the current guidelines do not protect populations of annuals and short-lived perennials, while they are overly restrictive for long-lived plants. We show that the maximum possible fraction of seed production - what can be harvested without compromising the long-term persistence of populations - is strongly related to the generation time of the target species. When harvesting every year, this safe seed fraction ranges from 80% in long-lived species to 2% in most annuals. Less frequent seed harvesting substantially increases the safe seed fraction: In the most vulnerable annual species, it is safe to harvest 5%, 10% or 30% of population seed production when harvesting every two, five or ten years, respectively. Our results provide a quantitative basis for seed harvesting legislations worldwide, based on species generation time and harvesting regime.

SignificanceThe UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, 2021-2030, foresees upscaling restoration, and the demand for native seed is skyrocketing. Seeds for restoring native vegetation are often harvested in wild, but too intensive harvest can threaten the donor populations. Existing guidelines that set limits to wild seed harvest are mostly based on expert opinions, yet they commonly lack empirical basis and vary among regions in one order of magnitude. We show that the current guidelines urgently need to be reformulated, because they are overly restrictive in long-lived species, while they do not protect annual plants from extinction. Using matrix population models of nearly 300 plant species, we provide a quantitative basis for a new seed harvesting legislation world-wide.","['sustainability', 'harvesting', 'seed', 'plant', 'global', 'skyrocketing', 'extinction', 'compromising', 'restrictive', 'ecological', 'ecology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
DYRK1A Interacts with the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Promotes mTORC1 Activity,"DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase, is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such as cell cycle, vesicle trafficking and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth; however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here, we show that the knockdown of DYRK1A results in reduced cell size, which depends on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Further, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity. Further, using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model, we show that the mnb, the fly homologues of DYRK1A, is rescued by RHEB overexpression, suggesting a conserved role of DYRK1A in TORC1 regulation.","['sclerosis', 'mtorc1', 'dyrk1a', 'interacts', 'promotes', 'kinase', 'sclerosis', 'neuromuscular', 'drosophila', 'phosphorylation', 'molecular biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
"PP1β opposes classic PP1 function, inhibiting spine maturation and promoting LTP","Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulates synaptic plasticity and has been described as a molecular constraint on learning and memory. There are three neuronal isoforms, PP1, PP1{beta}, and PP1{gamma}, but little is known about their individual functions. PP1 and PP1{gamma} are assumed to mediate the effects of PP1 on learning and memory based on their enrichment at dendritic spines and their preferential binding to neurabin and spinophilin, major PP1 synaptic scaffolding proteins. However, it was recently discovered that human de novo PP1{beta} mutations cause intellectual disability, suggesting an important but ill-defined role for PP1{beta}. In this study, we investigated the functions of each PP1 isoform in hippocampal synaptic physiology using conditional CA1-specific knockout mice. In stark contrast to classic PP1 function, we found that PP1{beta} promotes synaptic plasticity as well as spatial memory. These changes in synaptic plasticity and memory are accompanied by changes in GluA1 phosphorylation, GluN2A levels, and dendritic spine density and morphology, including silent synapse number. These functions of PP1{beta} reveal a previously unidentified signaling pathway regulating spine maturation and plasticity, broadening our understanding of the complex role of PP1 in synaptic physiology.","['opposes', 'inhibiting', 'pp1β', 'spine', 'ltp', 'hippocampal', 'molecular', 'protein', 'proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_no,
"The LCLAT1/LYCAT acyltransferase is required for EGF-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate generation and Akt signalling","Receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stimulate phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosophate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 then remodels actin and gene expression, and boosts cell survival and proliferation. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 partly achieves these functions by triggering activation of the kinase Akt, which phosphorylates targets like Tsc2 and GSK3{beta}. Consequently, unchecked upregulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-Akt signalling promotes tumour progression. Interestingly, 50-70% of PtdIns and PtdInsPs have stearate and arachidonate at sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerol, respectively, forming a species known as 38:4-PtdIns/PtdInsPs. LCLAT1 and MBOAT7 acyltransferases partly enrich PtdIns in this acyl format. We previously showed that disruption of LCLAT1 lowered PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels and perturbed endocytosis and endocytic trafficking. However, the role of LCLAT1 in receptor tyrosine kinase and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling was not explored. Here, we show that LCLAT1 silencing in MDA-MB-231 and ARPE-19 cells abated the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in response to EGF signalling. Importantly, LCLAT1-silenced cells were also impaired for EGF-driven and insulin-driven Akt activation and downstream signalling. Thus, our work provides first evidence that the LCLAT1 acyltransferase is required for receptor tyrosine kinase signalling.","['acyltransferase', 'phosphatidylinositol', 'trisphosphate', 'egf', 'lclat1', 'kinases', 'phosphatidylinositol', 'kinase', 'phosphoinositide', 'phosphorylates', 'cell biology']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
The effectiveness of selection in a species affects the direction of amino acid frequency evolution,"Nearly neutral theory predicts that species with higher effective population size (Ne) are better able to purge slightly deleterious mutations. We compare evolution in high-Ne vs. low-Ne vertebrates to reveal which amino acid frequencies are subject to subtle selective preferences. We take three complementary approaches, two measuring flux and one measuring outcomes. First, we fit non-stationary substitution models of amino acid flux using maximum likelihood, comparing the high-Ne clade of rodents and lagomorphs to its low-Ne sister clade of primates and colugos. Second, we compare evolutionary outcomes across a wider range of vertebrates, via correlations between amino acid frequencies and Ne. Third, we dissect the details of flux in human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat, as scored by parsimony - this also enables comparison to a historical paper. All three methods agree on which amino acids are preferred under more effective selection. Preferred amino acids tend to be smaller, less costly to synthesize, and to promote intrinsic structural disorder. Parsimony-induced bias in the historical study produces an apparent reduction in structural disorder, perhaps driven by slightly deleterious substitutions. Within highly exchangeable pairs of amino acids, arginine is strongly preferred over lysine, and valine over isoleucine, consistent with more effective selection preferring a marginally larger free energy of folding. These two preferences match differences between thermophiles and mesophilic relatives. These results reveal the biophysical consequences of mutation-selection-drift balance, and demonstrate the utility of nearly neutral theory for understanding protein evolution.

Significance statementAccording to the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, selection is less able to distinguish between similar alleles in species with lower population size. We identify which amino acids are subject to such weak preferences - these tend to be smaller, to be less costly to make, to promote structural disorder of proteins, and to be enriched in thermophiles relative to mesophiles. The latter agrees with theories of marginal protein stability under mutation-selection-drift balance.","['affects', 'evolution', 'selection', 'amino', 'frequency', 'chimpanzee', 'primates', 'evolutionary', 'alleles', 'rodents', 'evolutionary biology']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Signal Integration and Adaptive Sensory Diversity Tuning in Escherichia coli Chemotaxis,"In uncertain environments, phenotypic diversity can be advantageous for survival. However, as the environmental uncertainty decreases, the relative advantage of having diverse phenotypes decreases. Here, we show how populations of E. coli integrate multiple chemical signals to adjust sensory diversity in response to changes in the prevalence of each ligand in the environment. Measuring kinase activity in single cells, we quantified the sensitivity distribution to various chemoattractants in different mixtures of background stimuli. We found that when ligands bind uncompetitively, the population tunes sensory diversity to each signal independently, decreasing diversity when the signal ambient concentration increases. However, amongst competitive ligands the population can only decrease sensory diversity one ligand at a time. Mathematical modeling suggests that sensory diversity tuning benefits E. coli populations by modulating how many cells are committed to tracking each signal proportionally as their prevalence changes.","['escherichia', 'coli', 'chemotaxis', 'tuning', 'integration', 'kinase', 'chemoattractants', 'phenotypes', 'coli', 'phenotypic', 'systems biology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_no,

Unified bursting strategies in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns,"Transcription often occurs in bursts as gene promoters switch stochastically between active and inactive states. Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, despite responding to different transcription factors, all even-skipped enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their trans-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic even-skipped transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic even-skipped expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping even-skipped bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.","['bursting', 'unified', 'ectopic', 'patterns', 'skipped', 'upregulating', 'bursts', 'bursting', 'enhancers', 'increase', 'developmental biology']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Somatodendritic orientation determines tDCS-induced neuromodulation of Purkinje cell activity in awake mice.,"Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum is a promising non-invasive neuromodulatory technique being proposed for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how externally applied currents affect neuronal spiking activity in cerebellar circuits in vivo. We investigated how Cb-tDCS affects the firing rate of Purkinje cells (PC) and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the polarity-dependent modulation of neuronal activity induced by tDCS.

Mice (n = 9) were prepared for the chronic recording of LFPs to assess the actual electric field gradient imposed by Cb-tDCS in our experimental design. Single-neuron extracellular recording of PCs in awake (n = 24) and anesthetized (n = 27) mice was combined with juxtacellular recordings and subsequent staining of PC with neurobiotin under anesthesia (n = 8) to correlate their neuronal orientation with their response to Cb-tDCS. Finally, a high-density Neuropixels recording system was used to demonstrate the relevance of neuronal orientation during the application of Cb-tDCS in awake mice (n = 6).

In this study, we observe that Cb-tDCS induces a heterogeneous polarity-dependent modulation of the firing rate of Purkinje cells (PC) and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex. We demonstrate that the apparently heterogeneous effects of tDCS on PC activity can be explained by taking into account the somatodendritic orientation relative to the electric field. Our findings highlight the need to consider neuronal orientation and morphology to improve tDCS computational models, enhance stimulation protocol reliability, and optimize effects in both basic and clinical applications.","['neuromodulation', 'mice', 'cell', 'awake', 'tdcs', 'neuropsychiatric', 'neuropixels', 'neuromodulatory', 'neurobiotin', 'neurological', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
A Novel C. elegans Memory Type Mediated by an Insulin/Phospholipase C Pathway,"Memories are often categorized into types, reflecting their behavioral, anatomical and molecular diversity: these classifications both aid understanding of the differences among varieties of memory and help delineate the unifying cross-species principles underlying them. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that an associative memory of the pairing of the normally attractive odorant benzaldehyde and starvation depends on de novo translation, is independent of CREB, and is produced by massed training: a pattern which does not correspond to any of the well-characterized molecular categories of invertebrate memory. Further, as has been shown for many memories in vertebrates, but not previously in nematodes, we find that formation of this memory continues after removal of the stimuli initially causing it, and that it is labile to disruption through protein synthesis inhibition following training, but that inhibition of proteasomal activity does not extend the duration of the memory. Previous findings have implicated insulin pathway signaling, which canonically regulates the transcription factor DAF- 16, as a key component of this benzaldehyde/starvation memory, however our results suggest that transcriptional inhibition has, at most, only moderate effects on memory formation. We find that insulin signaling instead acts to regulate phospholipase C, which in turn regulates memory through diacylglycerol signaling. These findings better characterize this model associative memory in relation to other invertebrate memory types and identify ways in which it both shares their traits and differs from them, as well as revealing a more complete picture of the molecular pathway underlying it.","['insulin', 'phospholipase', 'novel', 'elegans', 'memory', 'worm', 'caenorhabditis', 'diacylglycerol', 'insulin', 'protein', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
An Ensemble Metabolome-Epigenome Interaction Network Identifies Metabolite Modulators of Epigenetic Drugs,"Metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and citrate play an important moonlighting role by influencing the levels of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and regulating gene expression. This cross talk between metabolism and epigenome impacts numerous biological processes including development and tumorigenesis. However, the extent of moonlighting activities of cellular metabolites in modulating the epigenome is unknown. We developed a data-driven screen to discover moonlighting metabolites by constructing a histone PTM-metabolite interaction network using global chromatin profiles, metabolomics, and epigenetic drug sensitivity data from over 600 cell lines. Our ensemble statistical learning approach uncovered metabolites that are predictive of histone PTM levels and epigenetic drug sensitivity. We experimentally validated synergistic and antagonistic interactions between histone deacetylase and demethylase inhibitors with epigenetic metabolites kynurenic acid, pantothenate, and 1-methylnicotinamide. We apply our approach to track metaboloepigenetic interactions during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Overall, our data-driven approach unveils a broader range of metaboloepigenetic interactions than anticipated from previous studies, with implications for reversing aberrant epigenetic alterations and enhancing epigenetic therapies through diet.","['drugs', 'metabolite', 'metabolome', 'modulators', 'ensemble', 'metabolomics', 'tumorigenesis', 'moonlighting', 'chromatin', 'metaboloepigenetic', 'systems biology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Comparative analysis of amphibian genomes: an emerging resource for basic and applied research,"Amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates and are in dire need of conservation intervention to ensure their continued survival. They exhibit unique features including a high diversity of reproductive strategies, permeable and specialized skin capable of producing toxins and antimicrobial compounds, multiple genetic mechanisms of sex determination, and in some lineages, the ability to regenerate limbs and organs. Although genomics approaches would shed light on these unique traits and aid conservation, sequencing and assembly of amphibian genomes has lagged behind other taxa due to their comparatively large genome sizes. Fortunately, the development of long-read sequencing technologies and initiatives has led to a recent burst of new amphibian genome assemblies. Although growing, the field of amphibian genomics suffers from the lack of annotation resources, tools for working with challenging genomes, and lack of high-quality assemblies in multiple clades of amphibians. Here we analyze 51 publicly available amphibian genomes to evaluate their usefulness for functional genomics research. We report considerable variation in genome assembly quality and completeness, and report some of the highest transposable element and repeat contents of any vertebrate. Additionally, we detected an association between transposable element content and climatic variables. Our analysis provides evidence of conserved genome synteny despite the long divergence times of this group, but we also highlight inconsistencies in chromosome naming and orientation across genome assemblies. We discuss sequencing gaps in the phylogeny and suggest key targets for future sequencing endeavors. Finally, we propose increased investment in amphibian genomics research to promote their conservation.","['genomes', 'research', 'amphibian', 'analysis', 'comparative', 'amphibians', 'toxins', 'amphibian', 'threatened', 'inconsistencies', 'genomics']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Mechanistic home range capture-recapture models for the estimation of population density and landscape connectivity,"Spatial capture-recapture models (SCRs) provide an integrative statistical tool for analyzing animal movement and population patterns. Although incorporating home range formation with a theoretical basis of animal movement into SCRs can improve the prediction of animal space use in a heterogeneous landscape, this approach is challenging owing to the sparseness of recapture events.

In this study, we developed an advection-diffusion capture-recapture model (ADCR), which is an extension of SCRs incorporating home range formation with advection-diffusion formalism, providing a new framework to estimate population density and landscape permeability. we tested the unbiasedness of the estimator using simulated capture-recapture data generated by a step selection function. We also compared accuracy of population density estimates and home range shapes with those from an SCR incorporating the least-cost path. In addition, ADCR was applied to real dataset of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in Japan to demonstrate the capacity of the ADCR to detect geographical barriers that constrain animal movements.

Population density, permeability, and home range estimates of ADCR were unbiased over randomly determined sets of true parameters. Although the accuracy of density estimates by ADCR was nearly identical to those of existing models, the home range shape could be predicted more accurately by ADCR than by an SCR incorporating the least-cost path. For the application to bear dataset, ADCR could detect the effect of water body as a barrier of movement which is consistent with previous population genetic studies.

ADCR provides unique opportunities to elucidate both individual- and population-level ecological processes from capture-recapture data. By offering a formal link with step selection functions to estimate animal movement, it is suitable for simultaneously modeling with capture-recapture data and animal movement data. This study provides a basis for studies of the interplay between animal movement processes and population patterns.","['estimation', 'capture', 'mechanistic', 'landscape', 'home', 'genetic', 'theoretical', 'challenging', 'bear', 'study', 'ecology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
CXCR4 blockade alleviates pulmonary and cardiac outcomes in early COPD,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disease lacking effective treatment. Focusing on early COPD should help to discover disease modifying therapies. We aimed to examine the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in early COPD from both human samples and murine models. Blood samples and lung tissues of early COPD patients and controls were obtained in order to analyse CXCL12 and CXCR4 levels. To generate an early COPD model, ten-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for 10 weeks and intranasal instillations of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) for the last 5 weeks to mimic exacerbations. CXCR4 expressing cells number was increased in the blood of patients with COPD, as well as in the blood of exposed mice. Lung CXCL12 expression was higher in both early COPD patients and exposed mice. Exposed mice presented mild airway obstruction, peri-bronchial fibrosis and right heart thickening. The density of fibrocytes expressing CXCR4 was increased in the bronchial submucosa of these mice. Conditional inactivation of CXCR4 at adult stage as well as pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 with plerixafor injections improved lung function, reduced inflammation, and protected against CS and poly-(I:C)-induced airway and cardiac remodeling. CXCR4-/- and plerixafor-treated mice also had less CXCR4-expressing circulating cells and a lower density of peri-bronchial fibrocytes. We demonstrate that targeting CXCR4 has beneficial effects in an animal model of early COPD and provide a framework to translate these preclinical findings to clinical settings in a drug repurposing approach.","['cardiac', 'pulmonary', 'alleviates', 'outcomes', 'cxcr4', 'fibrosis', 'disease', 'inflammation', 'pulmonary', 'cardiac', 'pathology']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Impact of Phosphorylation on the Physiological Form of Human alpha-Synuclein in Aqueous Solution,"Serine 129 can be phosphorylated in pathological inclusions formed by the intrinsically disordered protein human -synuclein (AS), a key player in Parkinsons disease and other synucleinopathies. Here, molecular simulations provide insight into the structural ensemble of phosphorylated AS. The simulations suggest that phosphorylation does not impact the structural content of the physiological AS conformational ensemble in aqueous solution, as the phosphate group is mostly solvated. The hydrophobic region of AS contains {beta}-hairpin structures, which may increase the propensity of the protein to undergo amyloid formation, as seen in the non-physiological (non-acetylated) form of the protein in a recent molecular simulation study. Our findings are consistent with existing experimental data, with the caveat of the observed limitations of the force field for the phosphorylated moiety.

Testing for differences in polygenic scores in the presence of confounding,"Polygenic scores have become an important tool in human genetics, enabling the prediction of individuals' phenotypes from their genotypes. Understanding how the pattern of differences in polygenic score predictions across individuals intersects with variation in ancestry can provide insights into the evolutionary forces acting on the trait in question, and is important for understanding health disparities. However, because most polygenic scores are computed using effect estimates from population samples, they are susceptible to confounding by both genetic and environmental effects that are correlated with ancestry. The extent to which this confounding drives patterns in the distribution of polygenic scores depends on patterns of population structure in both the original estimation panel and in the prediction/test panel. Here, we use theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, to study the procedure of testing for an association between polygenic scores and axes of ancestry variation in the presence of confounding. We use a general model of genetic relatedness to describe how confounding in the estimation panel biases the distribution of polygenic scores in a way that depends on the degree of overlap in population structure between panels. We then show how this confounding can bias tests for associations between polygenic scores and important axes of ancestry variation in the test panel. Specifically, for any given test, there exists a single axis of population structure in the GWAS panel that needs to be controlled for in order to protect the test. Based on this result, we propose a new approach for directly estimating this axis of population structure in the GWAS panel. We then use simulations to compare the performance of this approach to the standard approach in which the principal components of the GWAS panel genotypes are used to control for stratification.","['confounding', 'polygenic', 'differences', 'testing', 'scores', 'genetics', 'genetic', 'phenotypes', 'polygenic', 'genotypes', 'genetics']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Remembering what is relevant: how is goal-directed memory reactivation supported by attentional selection?,"Goal-directed memory reactivation involves retrieving the most relevant information for the current behavioral goal. Previous research has linked this process to activations in the fronto-parietal network, but the underlying selection mechanisms remain poorly understood. The current electroencephalogram (EEG) study investigates attention as a possible mechanism supporting goal-directed retrieval. Participants learned associations between objects and two screen locations in an episodic long-term memory experiment. In a following phase, we changed the relevance of some locations to simulate goal-directed retrieval. This was subsequently contrasted to a control condition, in which the original associations remained unchanged. Behavior performance measured during final retrieval revealed faster and more confident responses in the selective vs. neutral condition. At the EEG level, we found significant differences in decoding accuracy, with above-chance effects in the selective cue condition but not in the neutral cue condition. Additionally, we observed a stronger posterior contralateral negativity and lateralized alpha power in the selective cue condition. Overall, these results suggest that attentional selection enhances task-relevant information accessibility, emphasizing its role in goal-directed memory retrieval.","['remembering', 'attentional', 'memory', 'selection', 'reactivation', 'retrieving', 'electroencephalogram', 'research', 'decoding', 'behavioral', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-23,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
Effect of cell membrane tension on the lifetime and size of mature clathrin-coated pits and their spatial distribution,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most characterized pathway for cells to internalize diverse receptor-bound cargo, such as proteins, nanoparticles, and viruses. However, the effect of membrane tension on clathrin-coated pit (CCP) maturation remains inadequately characterized. This study aimed to determine the effect of membrane tension on CCP maturation both spatially and temporarily, which remains a controversial and elusive issue. We obtained the sizes and spatial distributions of CCPs by the structured illumination microscopy of fixed cells and observed CCP lifetimes in live cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The processes of CCP maturation and abortion were reproduced numerically through Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that the growth time of CCP was more reasonably proportional to its volume rather than its surface area. We further investigated the spatial distribution of the membrane tension and size of CCPs, finding a significant positive correlation between the membrane tension and the size of mature CCPs spatially. This indicates that the CCPs tend to enrich in the highest-tension region, especially the mature ones. These results agreed with our numerical prediction that the CCP structure grew larger to overcome a higher energy barrier caused by higher background cell membrane tension. Our findings enhance the understanding of CCP maturation dynamics and underscore the importance of membrane tension in regulating CCP development.","['membrane', 'cell', 'pits', 'size', 'coated', 'endocytosis', 'viruses', 'nanoparticles', 'controversial', 'microscopy', 'biophysics']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Ras-dependent activation of BMAL2 regulates hypoxic metabolism in pancreatic cancer,"To identify drivers of malignancy in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we performed regulatory network analysis on a large collection of expression profiles from laser capture microdissected samples of PDAC and benign precursors. We discovered that BMAL2 plays a role in the initiation, progression, post resection survival, and KRAS activity in PDAC. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes led us to hypothe-size that it plays a role in regulating the response to hypoxia, a critical but poorly understood feature of PDAC physiology. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines revealed effects on viability and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Loss of BMAL2 also affected glycolysis and other metabolic processes. We found that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes. We also found that BMAL2 is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A upon exposure to hypoxia, but destabilizes HIF2A under hypoxia. These data demonstrate that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC and may serve as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.

Statement of significanceWe provide a comprehensive portrait of the molecular drivers behind pancreatic cancer initiation, progression and outcome. We discover a new genetic regulator of metabolic responses to low oxygen environments, a key feature of pancreatic cancer biology.

Therapeutic targeting of ACLY in T-ALL in vivo,"T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematological malignancy in need of novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we identify the ATP-citrate lyase ACLY as overexpressed and as a novel therapeutic target in T-ALL. To test the effects of ACLY in leukemia progression, we developed an isogenic model of NOTCH1-induced Acly conditional knockout leukemia. Importantly, we observed intrinsic antileukemic effects upon loss of ACLY, which further synergized with NOTCH1 inhibition in vivo. Metabolomic profiling upon ACLY loss revealed a metabolic crisis with reduced acetyl-CoA levels, as well as a decreased oxygen consumption rate. Gene expression profiling analyses showed that the transcriptional signature of ACLY loss very significantly correlates with the signature of MYC loss in vivo. Mechanistically, the decrease in acetyl-CoA led to reduced H3K27ac levels in Myc, resulting in transcriptional downregulation of Myc and drastically reduced MYC protein levels. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed a reciprocal relationship whereby ACLY itself is a direct transcriptional target of MYC, thus establishing a feedforward loop that is important for leukemia progression. Overall, our results identified a relevant ACLY-MYC axis and unveiled ACLY as a novel promising target for T-ALL treatment.","['therapeutic', 'vivo', 'targeting', 'acly', 'leukemia', 'lymphoblastic', 'hematological', 'malignancy', 'h3k27ac', 'cancer biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Microphase Separation Produces Interfacial Environment within Diblock Biomolecular Condensates,"The phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins is emerging as an important mechanism for cellular organization. However, efforts to connect protein sequences to the physical properties of condensates, i.e., the molecular grammar, are hampered by a lack of effective approaches for probing high-resolution structural details. Using a combination of multiscale simulations and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy experiments, we systematically explored a series of systems consisting of diblock elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). The simulations succeeded in reproducing the variation of condensate stability upon amino acid substitution and revealed different microenvironments within a single condensate, which we verified with environmentally sensitive fluorophores. The interspersion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues and a lack of secondary structure formation result in an interfacial environment, which explains both the strong correlation between ELP condensate stability and interfacial hydrophobicity scales, as well as the prevalence of protein-water hydrogen bonds. Our study uncovers new mechanisms for condensate stability and organization that may be broadly applicable.","['biomolecular', 'microphase', 'condensates', 'interfacial', 'environment', 'microscopy', 'reproducing', 'molecular', 'disordered', 'simulations', 'biophysics']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
When and why does motor preparation arise in recurrent neural network models of motor control?,"During delayed ballistic reaches, motor areas consistently display movement-specific activity patterns prior to movement onset. It is unclear why these patterns arise: while they have been proposed to seed an initial neural state from which the movement unfolds, recent experiments have uncovered the presence and necessity of ongoing inputs during movement, which may lessen the need for careful initialization. Here, we modelled the motor cortex as an input-driven dynamical system, and we asked what the optimal way to control this system to perform fast delayed reaches is. We find that delay-period inputs consistently arise in an optimally controlled model of M1. By studying a variety of network architectures, we could dissect and predict the situations in which it is beneficial for a network to prepare. Finally, we show that optimal input-driven control of neural dynamics gives rise to multiple phases of preparation during reach sequences, providing a novel explanation for experimentally observed features of monkey M1 activity in double reaching.","['neural', 'motor', 'network', 'preparation', 'control', 'neural', 'delayed', 'cortex', 'experimentally', 'preparation', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Differentiation and Integration of Competing Memories: A Neural Network Model,"What determines when neural representations of memories move together (integrate) or apart (differentiate)? Classic supervised learning models posit that, when two stimuli predict similar outcomes, their representations should integrate. However, these models have recently been challenged by studies showing that pairing two stimuli with a shared associate can sometimes cause differentiation, depending on the parameters of the study and the brain region being examined. Here, we provide a purely unsupervised neural network model that can explain these and other related findings. The model can exhibit integration or differentiation depending on the amount of activity allowed to spread to competitors -- inactive memories are not modified, connections to moderately active competitors are weakened (leading to differentiation), and connections to highly active competitors are strengthened (leading to integration). The model also makes several novel predictions -- most importantly, that when differentiation occurs as a result of this unsupervised learning mechanism, it will be rapid and asymmetric, and it will give rise to anticorrelated representations in the region of the brain that is the source of the differentiation.

"One-shot learning and robust recall with BTSP, a biological synaptic plasticity rule","Recent experimental studies in the awake brain have identified a rule for synaptic plasticity that is instrumental for the instantaneous creation of memory traces in area CA1 of the mammalian brain: Behavioral Time scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP). This one-shot learning rule differs in essential aspects from previously considered plasticity mechanisms. We introduce a transparent model for the core function of BTSP and establish a theory that enables a principled understanding of the system of memory traces that it creates. Our theoretical predictions and numerical simulations show that BTSP is able to create a functionally powerful content-addressable memory without the need for high-resolution synaptic weights. Furthermore, it reproduces the repulsion effect of human memory, whereby traces for similar memory items are pulled apart to enable differential downstream processing. Altogether, our results create a link between synaptic plasticity in area CA1 of the hippocampus and its network function. They also provide a blueprint for implementing content-addressable memory with on-chip learning capability in highly energy-efficient crossbar arrays of memristors.","['learning', 'biological', 'btsp', 'synaptic', 'robust', 'mammalian', 'learning', 'brain', 'memory', 'experimental', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
CD3+ T-cell: CD14+monocyte complexes are dynamic and increased with HIV and glucose intolerance,"An increased risk of cardiometabolic disease accompanies persistent systemic inflammation. Yet, the innate and adaptive immune system features in persons who develop these conditions remain poorly defined. Doublets, or cell-cell complexes, are routinely eliminated from flow cytometric and other immune phenotyping analyses, which limits our understanding of their relationship to disease states. Using well-characterized clinical cohorts, including participants with controlled HIV as a model for chronic inflammation and increased immune cell interactions, we show that circulating CD14+ monocytes complexed to CD3+ T cells are dynamic, biologically relevant, and increased in individuals with diabetes after adjusting for confounding factors. The complexes form functional immune synapses with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and greater glucose utilization. Furthermore, in persons with HIV, the CD3+T-cell: CD14+monocyte complexes had more HIV copies compared to matched CD14+ monocytes or CD4+ T cells alone. Our results demonstrate that circulating CD3+T-cell:CD14+monocyte pairs represent dynamic cellular interactions that may contribute to inflammation and cardiometabolic disease pathogenesis and may originate or be maintained, in part, by chronic viral infections. These findings provide a foundation for future studies investigating mechanisms linking T cell-monocyte cell-cell complexes to developing immune-mediated diseases, including HIV and diabetes.

"""When I talk about it, my eyes light up!"" Impacts of a national laboratory internship on community college student success","Participation in technical/research internships may improve undergraduate graduation rates and persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), yet little is known about the benefits of these activities a) for community college students, b) when hosted by national laboratories, and c) beyond the first few years after the internship. We applied Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to investigate alumni perspectives about how CCI at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) impacted their academic/career activities. We learned that alumni had low confidence and expectations of success in STEM as community college students. Participation in CCI increased their professional networks, expectations of success, and STEM skills, identity, and self-efficacy/confidence. Hispanic/Latinx alumni recalled the positive impact of mentors who prioritized personal connections, and women valued warm social environments. We propose several additions to the SCCT model, to better reflect the supports and barriers to STEM persistence for community college students.","['internship', 'laboratory', 'student', 'college', 'success', 'internships', 'academic', 'alumni', 'undergraduate', 'students', 'scientific communication and education']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
The small acid-soluble proteins of Clostridioides difficile regulate sporulation in a SpoIVB2-dependent manner,"Clostridioides difficile is a pathogen whose transmission relies on the formation of dormant endospores. Spores are highly resilient forms of bacteria that resist environmental and chemical insults. In recent work, we found that C. difficile SspA and SspB, two small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs), protect spores from UV damage and, interestingly, are necessary for the formation of mature spores. Here, we build upon this finding and show that C. difficile sspA and sspB are required for the formation of the spore cortex layer. Moreover, using an EMS mutagenesis selection strategy, we identified mutations that suppressed the defect in sporulation of C. difficile SASP mutants. Many of these strains contained mutations in CDR20291_0714 (spoIVB2) revealing a connection between the SpoIVB2 protease and the SASPs in the sporulation pathway. This work builds upon the hypothesis that the small acid-soluble proteins can regulate gene expression.

ImportanceC. difficile is easily spread through the production of highly resistant spores. Understanding how spores are formed could yield valuable insight into how the sporulation process can be halted to render spores that are sensitive to cleaning methods. Here, we identify another protein involved in the sporulation process that is seemingly controlled by the small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs). This discovery allows us to better understand how the C. difficile SASPs may bind to specific sites on the genome to regulate gene expression.","['spoivb2', 'proteins', 'acid', 'sporulation', 'clostridioides', 'bacteria', 'spores', 'pathogen', 'endospores', 'sporulation', 'microbiology']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Periaqueductal gray activates antipredatory neural responses in the amygdala of foraging rats,"Pavlovian fear conditioning research suggests that the interaction between the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) acts as a prediction error mechanism in the formation of associative fear memories. However, their roles in responding to naturalistic predatory threats, characterized by less explicit cues and the absence of reiterative trial-and-error learning events, remain unexplored. In this study, we conducted single-unit recordings in rats during an approach food-avoid predator task, focusing on the responsiveness of dPAG and BLA neurons to a rapidly approaching robot predator. Optogenetic stimulation of the dPAG triggered fleeing behaviors and increased BLA activity in naive rats. Notably, BLA neurons activated by dPAG stimulation displayed immediate responses to the robot, demonstrating heightened synchronous activity compared to BLA neurons that did not respond to dPAG stimulation. Additionally, the use of anterograde and retrograde tracer injections into the dPAG and BLA, respectively, coupled with c-Fos activation in response to predatory threats, indicates that the midline thalamus may play an intermediary role in innate antipredatory defensive functioning.","['rats', 'neural', 'amygdala', 'foraging', 'periaqueductal', 'rats', 'predator', 'antipredatory', 'fear', 'robot', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Arpin deficiency increases actomyosin contractility and vascular permeability,"Arpin was discovered as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex localized at the lamellipodial tip of fibroblasts, where it regulated migration steering. Recently, we showed that arpin stabilizes the epithelial barrier in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. However, expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells (EC) have not yet been described. Arpin mRNA and protein are expressed in EC and downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arpin depletion in HUVEC causes the formation of actomyosin stress fibers leading to increased permeability in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Instead, inhibitors of ROCK1 and ZIPK, kinases involved in the generation of stress fibers, normalize the loss-of-arpin effects on actin filaments and permeability. Arpin-deficient mice are viable but show a characteristic vascular phenotype in the lung including edema, microhemorrhage and vascular congestion, increased F-actin levels and vascular permeability. Our data show that, apart from being an Arp2/3 inhibitor, arpin is also a regulator of actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity.

SUMMARYThe expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells are unknown. We show that arpin controls actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity in an Arp2/3-independent manner via ROCK1/ZIPK. Arpin-deficient mice are viable, but also show increased basal and induced vascular permeability.","['vascular', 'permeability', 'increases', 'actomyosin', 'contractility', 'fibroblasts', 'endothelial', 'actomyosin', 'microhemorrhage', 'cytokines', 'cell biology']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Study design features increase replicability in cross-sectional and longitudinal brain-wide association studies,"Brain-wide association studies (BWAS) are a fundamental tool in discovering brain-behavior associations. Several recent studies showed that thousands of study participants are required for good replicability of BWAS because the standardized effect sizes (ESs) are much smaller than the reported standardized ESs in smaller studies. Here, we perform analyses and meta-analyses of a robust effect size index using 63 longitudinal and cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging studies from the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium (77,695 total scans) to demonstrate that optimizing study design is critical for increasing standardized ESs and replicability in BWAS. A meta-analysis of brain volume associations with age indicates that BWAS with larger variability in covariate have larger reported standardized ES. In addition, the longitudinal studies we examined reported systematically larger standardized ES than cross-sectional studies. Analyzing age effects on global and regional brain measures from the United Kingdom Biobank and the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we show that modifying longitudinal study design through sampling schemes improves the standardized ESs and replicability. Sampling schemes that improve standardized ESs and replicability include increasing between-subject age variability in the sample and adding a single additional longitudinal measurement per subject. To ensure that our results are generalizable, we further evaluate these longitudinal sampling schemes on cognitive, psychopathology, and demographic associations with structural and functional brain outcome measures in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development dataset. We demonstrate that commonly used longitudinal models can, counterintuitively, reduce standardized ESs and replicability. The benefit of conducting longitudinal studies depends on the strengths of the between-versus within-subject associations of the brain and non-brain measures. Explicitly modeling between-versus within-subject effects avoids averaging the effects and allows optimizing the standardized ESs for each separately. Together, these results provide guidance for study designs that improve the replicability of BWAS.","['studies', 'replicability', 'study', 'increase', 'features', 'biobank', 'thousands', 'alzheimers', 'neuroimaging', 'larger', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
The double-edged role of FASII regulator FabT in Streptococcus pyogenes infection,"In Streptococcus pyogenes, the type II fatty acid (FA) synthesis pathway FASII is feedback-controlled by the FabT repressor bound to an acyl-Acyl carrier protein. Despite FabT defects being linked to reduced virulence in animal models, spontaneous fabT mutants arise in vivo. To resolve this paradox, we characterized the conditions and mechanisms that require FabT activity, and those that promote fabT mutant emergence. The primary fabT mutant defect is energy dissipation: specific nutrients are consumed, but the mutant fails to grow on human tissue, cells, or cell filtrates where nutrients are limited. These features explain the FabT requirement during infection. Conversely, fabT mutants exhibited a marked growth advantage over the wild-type in biotopes rich in saturated FAs. fabT mutants emerge in this context, where continued FASII activity prevented environmental FA incorporation. An ex vivo muscle model demonstrated that wild-type S. pyogenes was inhibited, while fabT mutant growth was stimulated, but conditional to FASII activity. Our findings elucidate the rationale for emerging fabT mutants that improve survival in lipid-rich biotopes, but lead to a genetic impasse for infection.","['streptococcus', 'infection', 'pyogenes', 'double', 'regulator', 'streptococcus', 'mutants', 'mutant', 'genetic', 'lipid', 'microbiology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Using normative models pre-trained on cross-sectional data to evaluate longitudinal changes in neuroimaging data,"Longitudinal neuroimaging studies offer valuable insight into intricate dynamics of brain development, ageing, and disease progression over time. However, prevailing analytical approaches rooted in our understanding of population variation are primarily tailored for cross-sectional studies. To fully harness the potential of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we have to develop and refine methodologies that are adapted to longitudinal designs, considering the complex interplay between population variation and individual dynamics.

We build on normative modelling framework, which enables the evaluation of an individuals position compared to a population standard. We extend this framework to evaluate an individuals longitudinal change compared to the longitudinal change reflected by the (population) standard dynamics. Thus, we exploit the existing normative models pre-trained on over 58,000 individuals and adapt the framework so that they can also be used in the evaluation of longitudinal studies. Specifically, we introduce a quantitative metric termed ""z-diff"" score, which serves as an indicator of a temporal change of an individual compared to a population standard. Notably, our framework offers advantages such as flexibility in dataset size and ease of implementation.

To illustrate our approach, we applied it to a longitudinal dataset of 98 patients diagnosed with early-stage schizophrenia who underwent MRI examinations shortly after diagnosis and one year later.

Compared to cross-sectional analyses, which showed global thinning of grey matter at the first visit, our method revealed a significant normalisation of grey matter thickness in the frontal lobe over time. Furthermore, this result was not observed when using more traditional methods of longitudinal analysis, making our approach more sensitive to temporal changes.

Overall, our framework presents a flexible and effective methodology for analysing longitudinal neuroimaging data, providing insights into the progression of a disease that would otherwise be missed when using more traditional approaches.","['neuroimaging', 'trained', 'evaluate', 'data', 'normative', 'neuroimaging', 'analysing', 'mri', 'schizophrenia', 'insights', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
Acute targeted induction of gut-microbial metabolism affects host clock genes and nocturnal feeding,"The gut microbiota and host circadian clock mutually influence each other, and microbiota metabolism has been shown to play a role in regulating host circadian function via secretion of fermentation products. Microbial metabolism is dependent on the availability of nutrients for the microbiota, typically through the hosts food intake, making it challenging to disentangle the effect of host and microbiota metabolism. In this study, we acutely induced gut microbial metabolic activity without inducing host metabolism in mice. We found that increasing microbial metabolism in the gut altered circadian clock gene expression locally. Actuating microbiota metabolism also reduced host food intake beyond the calories provided by the microbiota, suggesting a systemic signaling effect of microbial metabolism on the host.","['feeding', 'genes', 'nocturnal', 'microbial', 'metabolism', 'microbiota', 'microbial', 'fermentation', 'metabolism', 'food', 'microbiology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
"Histone chaperone HIRA, Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein and p62/SQSTM1 coordinate to regulate inflammation during cell senescence.","Cellular senescence, a stress-induced stable proliferation arrest associated with an inflammatory Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), is a cause of aging. In senescent cells, Cytoplasmic Chromatin Fragments (CCFs) activate SASP via the anti-viral cGAS/STING pathway. PML protein organizes PML nuclear bodies (NBs), also involved in senescence and anti-viral immunity. The HIRA histone H3.3 chaperone localizes to PML NBs in senescent cells. Here, we show that HIRA and PML are essential for SASP expression, tightly linked to HIRAs localization to PML NBs. Inactivation of HIRA does not directly block expression of NF-{kappa}B target genes. Instead, an H3.3-independent HIRA function activates SASP through a CCF-cGAS-STING-TBK1-NF-{kappa}B pathway. HIRA physically interacts with p62/SQSTM1, an autophagy regulator and negative SASP regulator. HIRA and p62 co-localize in PML NBs, linked to their antagonistic regulation of SASP, with PML NBs controlling their spatial configuration. These results outline a role for HIRA and PML in regulation of SASP.","['leukemia', 'inflammation', 'cell', 'protein', 'histone', 'aging', 'autophagy', 'cytoplasmic', 'proliferation', 'cellular', 'cell biology']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Transcriptomics Reveals Tumorigenesis and Pathogen Response in Scombrid Puffy Snout Syndrome,"Scombrids represent some of the most economically important fisheries globally. However, increased interest in creating aquaculture systems for these fish has also increased the risk for disease emergence. One such disease, Puffy Snout Syndrome (PSS), causes collagenous tissue growths on the face in numerous scombrid taxa. PSS has mainly been documented in captive-held fish populations and can lead to high mortality rates. Despite this, little is known about the causative agent(s) of PSS and the immune response they elicit. Therefore, we leveraged metatranscriptomic data of PSS symptomatic-captive, asymptomatic-captive, and healthy-wild Pacific Mackerel (Scomber japonicus) to evaluate the physiological characteristics of PSS infections and identify a potential mechanism of disease. Captive symptomatic and asymptomatic mackerel showed distinct gene expression patterns from their wild counterparts. Genes involved in tumorigenesis, immune response, and tissue remodeling were overexpressed in captive-held fish. WNT9 was the most overexpressed gene in captive groups, and the WNT signaling pathway itself showed a ~3 fold increase in KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in captive animals. When captive fish were compared, asymptomatic fish showed lower expression of inflammation genes, but high expression of tumor suppressor genes compared to symptomatic-captive fish. Together, these host pathophysiological data and our past visual identification of RNA virus-like particles in afflicted tissues suggest that viral-mediated oncogenesis may be driving PSS in captive mackerel.","['tumorigenesis', 'transcriptomics', 'pathogen', 'scombrid', 'syndrome', 'aquaculture', 'fisheries', 'fish', 'viral', 'tumorigenesis', 'genomics']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
SynBot: An open-source image analysis software for automated quantification of synapses,"The formation of precise numbers of neuronal connections, known as synapses, is crucial for brain function. Therefore, synaptogenesis mechanisms have been one of the main focuses of neuroscience. Immunohistochemistry is a common tool for visualizing synapses. Thus, quantifying the numbers of synapses from light microscopy images enables screening the impacts of experimental manipulations on synapse development. Despite its utility, this approach is paired with low throughput analysis methods that are challenging to learn and results are variable between experimenters, especially when analyzing noisy images of brain tissue. We developed an open-source ImageJ-based software, SynBot, to address these technical bottlenecks by automating the analysis. SynBot incorporates the advanced algorithms ilastik and SynQuant for accurate thresholding for synaptic puncta identification, and the code can easily be modified by users. The use of this software will allow for rapid and reproducible screening of synaptic phenotypes in healthy and diseased nervous systems.

MotivationLight microscopy imaging of pre- and post-synaptic proteins from neurons in tissue or in vitro allows for the effective identification of synaptic structures. Previous methods for quantitative analysis of these images were time-consuming, required extensive user training, and the source code could not be easily modified. Here, we describe SynBot, a new open-source tool that automates the synapse quantification process, decreases the requirement for user training, and allows for easy modifications to the code.","['synbot', 'software', 'synapses', 'automated', 'open', 'neuroscience', 'neuronal', 'immunohistochemistry', 'algorithms', 'synaptogenesis', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Increasing adult neurogenesis protects mice from epilepsy.,"Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult neurogenesis would prevent epilepsy. Adult neurogenesis was selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete Bax in Nestin-CreERT2Baxfl/fl mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult neurogenesis exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were the more affected by Bax deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in Bax. The female mice with enhanced adult neurogenesis also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild type females or males, which is notable because these two hilar cell types are implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective Bax deletion to increase adult neurogenesis can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.","['epilepsy', 'mice', 'neurogenesis', 'adult', 'protects', 'epilepsy', 'neurogenesis', 'epileptogenesis', 'hippocampal', 'somatostatin', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Deep Mutational Scanning in Disease-related Genes with Saturation Mutagenesis-Reinforced Functional Assays (SMuRF),"Interpretation of disease-causing genetic variants remains a challenge in human genetics. Current costs and complexity of deep mutational scanning methods hamper crowd-sourcing approaches toward genome-wide resolution of variants in disease-related genes. Our framework, Saturation Mutagenesis-Reinforced Functional assays (SMuRF), addresses these issues by offering simple and cost-effective saturation mutagenesis, as well as streamlining functional assays to enhance the interpretation of unresolved variants. Applying SMuRF to neuromuscular disease genes FKRP and LARGE1, we generated functional scores for all possible coding single nucleotide variants, which aid in resolving clinically reported variants of uncertain significance.

Reactivating and Reorganizing Activity-Silent Working Memory Through Two Distinct Mechanisms After Pinging the Brain,"Recent studies have proposed that visual information can be maintained in an activity-silent state during working memory (WM), which can be reactivated by task-irrelevant high-contrast visual impulses (i.e., ""pinging the brain""). Although pinging the brain has become a popular tool for exploring activity-silent WM in recent years, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we directly compared the behavioral consequences and neural reactivation effects of context-independent and context-dependent pings to distinguish the noise-reduction and target-interaction hypotheses of pinging the brain. At first, in a behavioral study, we found that, compared with the baseline condition (no ping), only the horizontal context-dependent pings impaired recall performance. In a follow-up electroencephalogram study, our neural decoding results showed that the context-independent pings reactivated activity-silent WM transiently without changing the original WM representations or recall performance. In contrast, the context-dependent pings reactivated activity-silent WM more durably and further reorganized WM information by decreasing the dynamics of items neural representations. Notably, only the reactivation strength of the context-dependent pings correlated with recall performance and was modulated by the location of memorized items, with neural representations only being reactivated when both items and pings were presented horizontally. Together, our results provided evidence for two distinct mechanisms underlying pinging the brain, and the pings context played a critical role in reactivating and reorganizing activity-silent WM.","['memory', 'brain', 'reorganizing', 'pinging', 'silent', 'electroencephalogram', 'decoding', 'neural', 'behavioral', 'memory', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Reference genome of the ant Lasius platythorax,"Ants are a highly diversified insect family of the order Hymenoptera, with many fascinating characteristics such as eusociality, chemical communication, farming, or social parasitism. Moreover, ants frequent a wide variety of habitats from dry deserts, grasslands, and savannas to cold temperate forests. The ability of ants to inhabit such diverse habitat ranges demonstrates their adaptability and ecological resilience. However, little is known about the genetic underpinnings of this vast array of traits and their adaptive potential. Here, we generated a high-quality genome assembly for the ant species Lasius platythorax using long-read PacBio HiFi in combination with chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing. We successfully assembled the genome into 15 chromosome-level scaffolds ranging from 7.9 to 19.2 Mb and encompassing 204.6 Mb out of 235.3 Mb (total assembly), and a BUSCO score of 86% (Hymenoptera_odb10). Comparative genomics between the two sister species will provide insights into the genomic basis of trait differentiation.","['ant', 'genome', 'platythorax', 'lasius', 'reference', 'ants', 'ant', 'genomics', 'hymenoptera_odb10', 'genome', 'genomics']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Contextual AI models for single-cell protein biology,"Understanding protein function and developing molecular therapies require deciphering the cell types in which proteins act as well as the interactions between proteins. However, modeling protein interactions across biological contexts remains challenging for existing algorithms. Here, we introduce PINNACLE, a geometric deep learning approach that generates context-aware protein representations. Leveraging a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns on contextualized protein interaction networks to produce 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell type contexts across 24 tissues. PINNACLE's embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of the tissue hierarchy. Pretrained protein representations can be adapted for downstream tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations for resolving immuno-oncological protein interactions, and investigating drugs' effects across cell types. PINNACLE outperforms state-of-the-art models in nominating therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, and pinpoints cell type contexts with higher predictive capability than context-free models. PINNACLE's ability to adjust its outputs based on the context in which it operates paves way for diverse large-scale context-specific predictions in biology.","['biology', 'protein', 'ai', 'cell', 'contextual', 'biology', 'algorithms', 'proteins', 'molecular', 'protein', 'bioinformatics']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Effects of psychedelics on neurogenesis and brain plasticity: A systematic review,"In the mammalian brain, new neurons continue to be generated throughout life in a process known as adult neurogenesis. The role of adult-generated neurons has been broadly studied across laboratories, and mounting evidence suggests a strong link to the HPA axis and concomitant malfunctions in patients diagnosed with mood disorders. Psychedelic compounds, such as phenethylamines, tryptamines, cannabinoids, and a variety of ever-growing chemical categories, have emerged as therapeutic options for neuropsychiatric disorders, while numerous reports link their effects to increased adult neurogenesis. In this systematic review, we examine studies assessing neurogenesis or neurogenesis-associated brain plasticity after psychedelic interventions and aim to provide a comprehensive picture of how this vast category of compounds regulates the generation of new neurons. We conducted a literature search on PubMed and Science Direct databases, considering all articles published until January 31, 2023, and selected articles containing both the words ""neurogenesis"" and ""psychedelics"". We analyzed experimental studies using either in vivo or in vitro models, employing classical or atypical psychedelics at all ontogenetic windows, as well as human studies referring to neurogenesis-associated plasticity. Of a total of 205 articles, 68 met all the necessary conditions for further review. Our findings were divided into five main categories of psychedelics: CB1 agonists, NMDA antagonists, harmala alkaloids, tryptamines, and entactogens. We described the outcomes of neurogenesis assessments and investigated related results on the effects of psychedelics on brain plasticity and behavior within our sample. In summary, this review presents an extensive study into how different psychedelics may affect the birth of new neurons and other brain-related processes. Such knowledge may be valuable for future research on novel therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.","['psychedelics', 'neurogenesis', 'brain', 'review', 'plasticity', 'neuropsychiatric', 'neurogenesis', 'psychedelics', 'mammalian', '2023', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
Cross-transmission of resistant gastrointestinal nematodes between wildlife and transhumant sheep,"Wild and domestic ungulates can be infected with the same species of gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes. These parasites have free-living stages in the environment that contribute to the ease of transmission among different host species. In addition, gastrointestinal nematodes have developed resistance to anthelmintics which is now considered a major problem for the livestock sector. In a context where wild and domestic ungulates share the same pastures, the maintenance and circulation of resistant gastrointestinal nematodes between species have rarely been explored.

In the European Alps, domestic sheep are driven to high-altitude summer pastures and live in sympatry with wild ungulates for several months each year. In this study, we investigated the nemabiome of domestic sheep and Alpine ibex, Capra ibex, in three different areas of the French Alps to evaluate parasite circulation between the two host species. The Alpine ibex is a protected mountain ungulate that is phylogenetically related to sheep and hosts nematode species common to sheep.

Using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) nemabiome metabarcoding, we found sheep and ibex share similar gastrointestinal nematodes, except for a few species such as Marshallagia marshalli and Trichostrongylus axei. This suggests that the long-term co-occurrence of sheep and ibex on mountain pastures has promoted the exchange of gastrointestinal nematodes between the two hosts. Based on the sequencing of the isotype 1 of the beta tubulin gene, associated with benzimidazole resistance, we found resistant nematodes in all sheep flocks and in all ibex populations. Our results demonstrated that ibex can host and shed resistant strains before transhumant sheep arrive on pastures, and thus could act as refuge or even contribute to maintain resistant gastrointestinal nematodes. The relative role of ibex in the maintenance and circulation of resistant strains in sheep remain to be determined.","['sheep', 'gastrointestinal', 'wildlife', 'transhumant', 'nematodes', 'sheep', 'livestock', 'gastrointestinal', 'parasites', 'parasite', 'ecology']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
EEG-fMRI in awake rat and whole-brain simulations show decreased brain responsiveness to sensory stimulations during absence seizures,"In patients suffering absence epilepsy, recurring seizures can significantly decrease their quality of life and lead to yet untreatable comorbidities. Absence seizures are characterized by spike-and- wave discharges on the electroencephalogram associated with a transient alteration of consciousness. However, it is still unknown how the brain responds to external stimuli during and outside of seizures.

This study aimed to investigate responsiveness to visual and somatosensory stimulation in GAERS, a well-established rat model for absence epilepsy. Animals were imaged under non-curarized awake state using a quiet, zero-echo-time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole brain hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between states.

During a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In the cortex, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The mean-field simulation revealed restricted propagation of activity due to stimulation and agreed well with fMRI findings. Results suggest that sensory processing is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.","['seizures', 'rat', 'decreased', 'fmri', 'absence', 'epilepsy', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'electroencephalogram', 'comorbidities', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Incremental Self-Organization of Spatio-Temporal Spike Pattern Detection,"Brains learn new information while retaining already acquired contents. It is not known by what mechanisms synapses preserve previously stored memories while they are plastic and contribute to further learning. To understand how this notorious stability-plasticity dilemma might be resolved, we investigate a one layer self-supervised neural network that incrementally learns to detect new spatio-temporal spike patterns without loosing existing selectivities. A plausible combination of Hebbian mechanisms, hetero-synaptic plasticity, and synaptic scaling enables unsupervised learning of spatio-temporal input patterns by single neurons. In networks acquisition of different patterns one after the other is achieved by including pre-synaptic hetero-synaptic plasticity which enforces differentiation of the neurons selectivities. We found, however, that only when additionally the training spikes are both, jittered and stochastic past memories persist despite ongoing learning. This input variability selects a subset of weights and drives them into a regime where synaptic scaling induces self-stabilization. Thereby our model provides a novel explanation for the stability of synapses related to preexisting contents despite ongoing plasticity, and suggests how nervous systems could incrementally learn and exploit temporally precise Poisson rate codes.

Significance StatementActivity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to underlie learning. While ongoing synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning new content, it is detrimental to the traces of previously acquired memories. Here, we show how memories for spatio-temporal patterns can be protected from overwriting. A combination of biologically plausible synaptic plasticity mechanisms turns single neurons into robust detectors of statistically dominant input patterns. For networks, we find that memory stability is achieved when the patterns to be learned are temporally sloppy and noisy, as opposed to being frozen. This variability drives the relevant synaptic weights to large efficacies, where they become self-reinforcing and continue to support the initially learned patterns. As a result, such a network can incrementally learn one pattern after another.","['detection', 'incremental', 'pattern', 'temporal', 'spike', 'neural', 'learning', 'neurons', 'memories', 'memory', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Saponin Nanoparticle Adjuvants Incorporating Toll-Like Receptor Agonists Drive Distinct Immune Signatures and Potent Vaccine Responses,"Over the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.","['vaccine', 'nanoparticle', 'receptor', 'immune', 'potent', 'vaccines', 'decades', 'vaccine', 'viruses', 'influenza', 'bioengineering']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
A conserved odorant receptor underpins borneol-mediated repellency in culicine mosquitoes,"The use of essential oils derived from the camphor tree to repel mosquitoes is an ancient practice that originated in Southeast Asia and gradually spread to China and across Europe via the Maritime Silk Road. The olfactory mechanisms by which these oils elicit avoidance behavior are unclear. Here we show that plant bicyclic monoterpenoids and borneol specifically activate a neural pathway that originates in the orphan olfactory receptor neuron of the capitate peg sensillum in the maxillary palp, and projects to the mediodorsal glomerulus 3 in the antennal lobe. This neuron co-locates with two olfactory receptor neurons tuned to carbon dioxide and octenol that mediate human-host detection. We also confirm that borneol elicits repellency against human-seeking female mosquitoes. Understanding the functional role of the mosquito maxillary palp is essential to investigating olfactory signal integration and host-selection behavior.","['mosquitoes', 'odorant', 'receptor', 'repellency', 'culicine', 'mosquitoes', 'mosquito', 'china', 'silk', 'tree', 'evolutionary biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Modelling human neuronal catecholaminergic pigmentation in rodents recapitulates age-related multisystem neurodegenerative deficits,"One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinsons, Alzheimers and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model may open new research avenues in brain aging and neurodegeneration.","['rodents', 'neurodegenerative', 'neuronal', 'catecholaminergic', 'pigmentation', 'neurodegenerative', 'parkinsons', 'alzheimers', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuromelanin', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Structural basis for coupling of the WASH subunit FAM21 with the endosomal SNX27-Retromer complex,"Endosomal membrane trafficking is mediated by specific protein coats and formation of actin-rich membrane domains. The Retromer complex coordinates with sorting nexin (SNX) cargo adaptors including SNX27, and the SNX27-Retromer assembly interacts with the WASH complex which nucleates actin filaments establishing the endosomal reycling domain. Crystal structures, modelling, biochemical and cellular validation reveal how the FAM21 subunit of WASH interacts with both Retromer and SNX27. FAM21 binds the FERM domain of SNX27 using acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs similar to those found in the SNX1 and SNX2 subunits of the ESCPE-1 complex. Overlapping FAM21 repeats and a specific Pro-Leu containing motif bind three distinct sites on Retromer involving both the VPS35 and VPS29 subunits. Mutation of the major VPS35-binding site does not prevent cargo recycling, however it partially reduces endosomal WASH association indicating that a network of redundant interactions promote endosomal activity of the WASH complex. These studies establish the molecular basis for how SNX27-Retromer is coupled to the WASH complex via overlapping and multiplexed motif-based interactions required for the dynamic assembly of endosomal membrane recycling domains.","['fam21', 'snx27', 'endosomal', 'retromer', 'wash', 'protein', 'biochemical', 'molecular', 'actin', 'snx27', 'cell biology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Spider mites collectively avoid plants with cadmium irrespective of their frequency or the presence of competitors,"Accumulation of heavy metals by plants can serve as a defence against herbivory. Herbivores, in turn, may avoid feeding on contaminated tissues. Such avoidance, however, may hinge upon the specific conditions faced by herbivores. Here, we tested whether the spider mite Tetranychus urticae avoids tomato plants contaminated with cadmium in presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics and depending on the frequency of contaminated plants. We show that individual spider mite females do not preferentially move to leaf tissues with or without cadmium, despite clear costs on their performance. However, in a set-up where 200 mites were simultaneously given the choice between four plants with or without cadmium, they collectively avoided plants with cadmium, irrespective of the proportion of plants with cadmium. In addition, T. urticae did not discriminate between plants infested with its competitor T. evansi and other uncontaminated plants but they preferred plants with competitors when the other plants contained cadmium. Our results show that aggregation may facilitate avoidance of contaminated plants. They also indicate that cadmium accumulation in plants is a stronger selective pressure than interspecific competition with T. evansi. Therefore, collective avoidance of metal-accumulating plants by herbivores is robust to environmental conditions and may have important consequences for species distribution and interactions in metal contaminated sites.","['spider', 'mites', 'irrespective', 'avoid', 'cadmium', 'spider', 'herbivory', 'herbivores', 'contaminated', 'mites', 'ecology']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
Single-molecule analysis reveals the phosphorylation of FLS2 governs its spatiotemporal dynamics and immunity,"The Arabidopsis thaliana FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2 (FLS2), a typical receptor kinase, recognizes the conserved 22 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22) to initiate plant defense pathways, which was intensively studied in the past decades. However, the dynamic regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation at the plasma membrane after flg22 recognition needs further elucidation. Through single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that upon flg22 treatment, the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in FLS2 impacts its spatiotemporal dynamics and lifetime. Following forster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime (FRET-FLIM) imaging microscopy and protein proximity indexes (PPI) assays revealed that flg22 treatment increased the co-localization of GFP-tagged FLS2/FLS2S938D but not FLS2S938A with AtRem1.3-mCherry, a sterol-rich lipid marker, indicating that the phosphorylation of FLS2S938 affects FLS2 sorting efficiency to AtRem1.3-associated nanodomains. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 enhanced flg22-induced FLS2 internalization and immune responses, demonstrating that the phosphorylation may activate flg22-triggered immunity through partitioning FLS2 into functional AtRem1.3-associated nanodomains, which fills the gap between the FLS2S938 phosphorylation and FLS2-mediated immunity.","['phosphorylation', 'fls2', 'molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'immunity', 'fls2s938a', 'kinase', 'flg22', 'fls2s938d', 'decades', 'plant biology']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Kinetic Proofreading can Enhance Specificity in a Non-enzymatic DNA Strand Displacement Network,"Kinetic proofreading is used throughout natural systems to enhance the specificity of molecular recognition. At its most basic level, kinetic proofreading uses a supply of chemical fuel to drive a recognition interaction out of equilibrium, allowing a single free-energy difference between correct and incorrect targets to be exploited two or more times. Despite its importance in biology, there has been little effort to incorporate kinetic proofreading into synthetic systems in which molecular recognition is important, such as nucleic acid nanotechnology. In this article, we introduce a DNA strand displacement-based kinetic proofreading motif, showing that the consumption of a DNA-based fuel can be used to enhance molecular recognition during a templated dimerization reaction. We then show that kinetic proofreading can enhance the specificity with which a probe discriminates single nucleotide mutations, both in terms of the initial rate with which the probe reacts and the long-time behaviour.","['dna', 'proofreading', 'enzymatic', 'strand', 'kinetic', 'biology', 'nanotechnology', 'dna', 'molecular', 'proofreading', 'biophysics']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Neuronal APOE4-induced Early Hippocampal Network Hyperexcitability in Alzheimers Disease Pathogenesis,"The full impact of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), on neuronal and network function remains unclear. We found hippocampal region-specific network hyperexcitability in young APOE4 knock-in (E4-KI) mice which predicted cognitive deficits at old age. Network hyperexcitability in young E4-KI mice was mediated by hippocampal region-specific subpopulations of smaller and hyperexcitable neurons that were eliminated by selective removal of neuronal APOE4. Aged E4-KI mice exhibited hyperexcitable granule cells, a progressive inhibitory deficit, and E/I imbalance in the dentate gyrus, exacerbating hippocampal hyperexcitability. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed neuronal cell type-specific and age-dependent transcriptomic changes, including Nell2 overexpression in E4-KI mice. Reducing Nell2 expression in specific neuronal types of E4-KI mice with CRISPRi rescued their abnormal excitability phenotypes, implicating Nell2 overexpression as a cause of APOE4-induced hyperexcitability. These findings highlight the early transcriptomic and electrophysiological alterations underlying APOE4-induced hippocampal network dysfunction and its contribution to AD pathogenesis with aging.","['alzheimers', 'hippocampal', 'pathogenesis', 'disease', 'apoe4', 'alzheimers', 'hippocampal', 'aging', 'old', 'transcriptomic', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Learning the sequence code of protein expression in human immune cells,"Accurate protein expression in human immune cells is essential for appropriate cellular function. The mechanisms that define protein abundance are complex and executed on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level. Here, we present SONAR, a machine learning pipeline that learns the endogenous sequence code and that defines protein abundance in human cells. SONAR uses thousands of sequence features (SFs) to predict up to 63% of the protein abundance independently of promoter or enhancer information. SONAR uncovered the cell type-specific and activation-dependent usage of SFs. The deep knowledge of SONAR provides a map of biologically active SFs, which can be leveraged to manipulate the amplitude, timing, and cell type-specificity of protein expression. SONAR informed on the design of enhancer sequences to boost T cell receptor expression and to potentiate T cell function. Beyond providing fundamental insights in the regulation of protein expression, our study thus offers novel means to improve therapeutic and biotechnology applications.","['protein', 'learning', 'cells', 'immune', 'code', 'sonar', 'biotechnology', 'protein', 'enhancer', 'receptor', 'immunology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
SIRT1 and SIRT3 impact host mitochondrial function and host- Salmonella pH balance during infection,"Mitochondria are an important organelle regulating energy homeostasis. Mitochondrial health and dynamics are crucial determinants of the outcome of several bacterial infections. SIRT3, a major mitochondrial sirtuin, along with SIRT1 regulates key mitochondrial functions. This led to considerable interest in understanding the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in governing mitochondrial functions during Salmonella infection. Here, we show that loss of SIRT1 and SIRT3 function either by shRNA-mediated knockdown or inhibitor treatment led to increased mitochondrial dysfunction with alteration in mitochondrial bioenergetics alongside increased mitochondrial superoxide generation in the Salmonella-infected macrophages. Consistent with dysfunctional mitochondria, mitophagy was induced along with altered mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics in S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages. Additionally, the mitochondrial bioenergetic alteration promotes acidification of the infected macrophage cytosolic pH. This host cytosolic pH imbalance skewed the intra-phagosomal and intra- bacterial pH in the absence of SIRT1 and SIRT3, resulting in decreased SPI-2 gene expression. Our results suggest a novel role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in maintaining the intracellular Salmonella niche by modulating the mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics in the infected macrophages.

Evolving alterations of structural organization and functional connectivity in feedforward neural networks after induced P301L tau mutation,"Reciprocal structure function relationships underlie both healthy and pathological behaviors in complex neural networks. Thus, understanding neuropathology and network dysfunction requires a thorough investigation of the complex interactions between structural and functional network reconfigurations in response to perturbation. Such adaptations are often difficult to study in vivo. For example, subtle, evolving changes in synaptic connectivity, transmission, and the electrophysiological shift from healthy to pathological states, as for example alterations that may be associated with evolving neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimers, are difficult to study in the brain. Engineered in vitro neural networks are powerful models that enable selective targeting, manipulation, and monitoring of dynamic neural network behavior at the micro and mesoscale in physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we engineered feedforward cortical neural networks using two nodal microfluidic devices with controllable connectivity interfaced with microelectrode arrays (mMEAs). We induced P301L mutated tau protein to the presynaptic node of these networks and monitored network dynamics over three weeks. Induced perturbation resulted in altered structural organization and extensive axonal retraction starting in the perturbed node. Perturbed networks also exhibited functional changes in intranodal activity, which manifested as an overall decline in both firing rate and bursting activity, with a progressive increase in synchrony over time, and decrease in internodal signal propagation between pre and postsynaptic nodes. These results provide insights into dynamic structural and functional reconfigurations at the micro and mesoscale as a result of evolving pathology and illustrate the utility of engineered networks as models of network function and dysfunction.","['mutation', 'alterations', 'neural', 'evolving', 'p301l', 'neurodegenerative', 'neuropathology', 'electrophysiological', 'difficult', 'pathological', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Notch3 deletion regulates HIV-1 gene expression and systemic inflammation to ameliorate chronic kidney disease,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased HIV-1 associated morbidity. However, despite ART, immune cells remain latently infected and slowly release viral proteins, leading to chronic inflammation and HIV-1 associated comorbidities. New strategies are needed to target viral proteins and inflammation. We found activation of Notch3 in several renal cells of the HIV-1 mouse model (HIV-Tg26) and in patients with HIV associated Nephropathy. We hypothesized that targeting Notch3 activation constitutes an effective therapy for HIV-related chronic kidney diseases (HIV-CKD). We generated HIV-Tg26 mice with Notch3 knocked out (Tg-N3KO). Compared to HIV-Tg26 mice at 3 months, HIV-Tg-N3KO mice showed a marked reduction in renal injury, skin lesions and mortality rate. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that N3KO not only reduced renal infiltrating cells but significantly reduced the expression of HIV genes. Moreover, Notch3 activated the HIV-promoter and induction of HIV-1 resulted in increased Notch3 activation indicating a feedback mechanism. Further, bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from HIV-Tg26 mice showed activation of Notch3 indicating systemic effects. Consistent with that, systemic levels of TNF-, MCP-1 and other inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were reduced in Tg-N3KO mice. Thus, Notch3 inhibition/deletion has a dual therapeutic effect in HIV-CKD and may extend to other HIV-related pathologies.","['hiv', 'kidney', 'disease', 'notch3', 'gene', 'hiv', 'therapy', 'therapeutic', 'cytokines', 'kidney', 'molecular biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,

casmini-tool: a comprehensive database for efficient and specific guide RNA design using dCasMINI,"The dCasMINI protein is a hypercompact, nuclease-inactivated CRISPR-Cas system engineered for transcriptional modulation and epigenetic editing [Xu et al., 2021]. The small size of dCas-MINI (529 amino acids), less than half the size of comparable Cas9 molecules, makes it ideal for AAV-based therapies which are frequently limited by AAVs small cargo capacity. Unlike Cas9 or Cas12a, there are no available computational tools for designing dCasMINI guides. To facilitate and accelerate the development of dCasMINI-based applications, we synthesized knowledge regarding dCasMINI guide design and built a website to assist researchers in designing optimal guides for dCasMINI-based experiments for transcriptional inhibition (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa); to ensure that our tool would be useful for therapeutic guide design, in which a guides off-target safety profile is of paramount importance, we specifically optimized alignment parameters for high-sensitivity to comprehensively report genome-wide off-targets. To investigate dCasMINIs full protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) profile, we engineered libraries of PAMs and exhaustively characterized dCasMINIs ability to activate a locus with different PAMs. We also experimentally investigated the importance of each nucleotide position on the guide RNAs ability to activate its target, and characterized a 6bp high-fidelity seed region at the 5 end of the protospacer sequence which we identified to be intolerant to mismatches and deletions, and thus critical for true binding events. Taken together, our tool offers CRISPRi/a guide design for every protein-coding gene in the human genome along with comprehensive off-target prediction, incorporating the most up-to-date information about dCasMINIs full PAM and protospacer design rules.

Reducing individual differences in task fMRI with OGRE (One-step General Registration and Extraction) preprocessing,"Volumetric analysis methods continue to enjoy great popularity in the analysis of task-related functional MRI (fMRI) data.

However, it remains unknown what advantages might be gained by integrating FSL with alternative preprocessing tools. Here we developed the One-step General Registration and Extraction (OGRE) pipeline to apply FreeSurfer brain extraction for simultaneous registration and motion correction (""one-step resampling""), for FSL volumetric analysis of fMRI data. We compared three preprocessing approaches (OGRE, FSL, and fMRIPrep) in a dataset wherein adult human volunteers (N=39) performed a precision drawing task during fMRI scanning. The three approaches produced grossly similar results, but OGREs preprocessing led to lower inter-individual variability across the brain and greater detected activation in primary motor cortex contralateral to movement. This demonstrates that FreeSurfer tools and one-step resampling can improve FSLs volumetric analysis of fMRI data. The OGRE pipeline provides an off-the-shelf method to apply FreeSurfer-based brain extraction and one-step resampling of motion correction and registration for FSL analysis of task fMRI data.","['preprocessing', 'extraction', 'reducing', 'fmri', 'step', 'mri', 'freesurfer', 'popularity', 'fmrib', 'resampling', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Brain-to-brain coupling forecasts future joint action outcomes,"In this study, we investigated whether brain-to-brain coupling patterns could predict performance in a time-estimation task which requires two players to cooperate. The participant pairs, were tasked with synchronising button presses after converging on a shared representation of short, medium, and long time intervals while utilizing feedback to adjust responses. We employed EEG-hyperscanning and focused on post-feedback brain activity. We found that negative feedback led to increased frontal mid-line theta activity across individuals. Moreover, a correlation in post-feedback theta power between players forecasted failed joint action, while an anti-correlation forecasted success. These findings suggest that temporally coupled feedback related brain activity between two individuals serves as an indicator of redundancy in adjustment of a common goal representation. Additionally, the anti-correlation of this activity reflects cognitive strategic mechanisms that ensure optimal joint action outcomes. Rather than a paired overcompensation, successful cooperation requires flexible strategic agility from both partners.","['future', 'forecasts', 'outcomes', 'coupling', 'action', 'synchronising', 'overcompensation', 'cognitive', 'button', 'feedback', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Individual Differences Elucidate the Perceptual Benefits Associated with Robust Temporal Fine-Structure Processing,"The auditory system is unique among sensory systems in its ability to phase lock to and precisely follow very fast cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in the phase of sound-driven cochlear vibrations. Yet, the perceptual role of this temporal fine structure (TFS) code is debated. This fundamental gap is attributable to our inability to experimentally manipulate TFS cues without altering other perceptually relevant cues. Here, we circumnavigated this limitation by leveraging individual differences across 200 participants to systematically compare variations in TFS sensitivity to performance in a range of speech perception tasks. TFS sensitivity was assessed through detection of interaural time/phase differences, while speech perception was evaluated by word identification under noise interference. Results suggest that greater TFS sensitivity is not associated with greater masking release from fundamental-frequency or spatial cues, but appears to contribute to resilience against the effects of reverberation. We also found that greater TFS sensitivity is associated with faster response times, indicating reduced listening effort. These findings highlight the perceptual significance of TFS coding for everyday hearing.

Significance StatementNeural phase-locking to fast temporal fluctuations in sounds-temporal fine structure (TFS) in particular- is a unique mechanism by which acoustic information is encoded by the auditory system. However, despite decades of intensive research, the perceptual relevance of this metabolically expensive mechanism, especially in challenging listening settings, is debated. Here, we leveraged an individual-difference approach to circumnavigate the limitations plaguing conventional approaches and found that robust TFS sensitivity is associated with greater resilience against the effects of reverberation and is associated with reduced listening effort for speech understanding in noise.","['benefits', 'perceptual', 'processing', 'elucidate', 'associated', 'cochlear', 'expensive', 'acoustic', 'auditory', 'sensory', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-21,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Transcriptomic profiling of an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis uncovers potential genes and pathways involved into the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease,"We characterized the transcriptional profiles of erythroid cells differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from peripheral blood collected from patients diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), which have been treated with Hydroxyurea (HU) in comparison to untreated SCD patients and healthy controls (HC) using bulk RNAseq. We identified 1398 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SCD non-treated-derived erythroid cells and 495 DEGs in SCD HU-treated patient-derived erythroid cells compared to HC. We found biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation pathway, proteasome, autophagy, natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxicity, adaptive immune response or inflammatory response to be significantly enriched in our patient study groups by using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Our findings collectively suggest different as well as common molecular signatures between our groups. We could validate 12 of our top DEGs in treated patients by qRT-PCR. We found similar regulation patterns when comparing the mRNA levels of mutS homolog 5- Suppressor APC Domain Containing 1 (MSH5-SAPCD1), G protein subunit gamma 4 (GNG4), stabilin 1/ clever-1 (STAB1) and Fas Binding Factor 1 (FBF1) from the bone marrow cells and spleen tissue from the Berkely SCD mouse model to the expressions observed in the transcriptome of our ex-vivo patient-derived erythropoiesis model.","['transcriptomic', 'pathogenesis', 'genes', 'erythropoiesis', 'disease', 'pcr', 'genomes', 'genes', 'spleen', 'transcriptome', 'molecular biology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Mechanical imbalance between normal and transformed cells drives epithelial homeostasis through cell competition,"Cell competition in epithelial tissue eliminates transformed cells expressing activated oncoproteins to maintain epithelial homeostasis. Although the process is now understood to be of mechanochemical origin, direct mechanical characterization and associated biochemical underpinnings are lacking. Here, we employ tissue-scale stress and compressibility measurements and theoretical modeling to unveil a mechanical imbalance between normal and transformed cells, which drives cell competition. In the mouse intestinal epithelium and epithelial monolayer, transformed cells get compacted during competition. Stress microscopy reveals an emergent compressive stress at the transformed loci leading to this compaction. A cell-based self-propelled Voronoi model predicts that this compressive stress originates from a difference in the collective compressibility of the competing populations. A new collective compressibility measurement technique named gel compression microscopy then elucidates a two-fold higher compressibility of the transformed population than the normal population. Mechanistically, weakened cell-cell adhesions due to reduced junctional abundance of E-cadherin in the transformed cells render them collectively more compressible than normal cells. Taken together, our findings unveil a mechanical basis for epithelial homeostasis against oncogenic transformations with implications in epithelial defense against cancer.","['imbalance', 'competition', 'homeostasis', 'epithelial', 'mechanical', 'cancer', 'biochemical', 'mechanochemical', 'mouse', 'mechanistically', 'biophysics']",,2024-06-22,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
Targeting lignocellulolytic gene clusters in novel Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma harzianum strains through Bac-guided analysis,"Lignocellulosic biomass is known as a challenging substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis, increasing the processing cost in biorefineries. In nature, filamentous fungi, including those of the genus Trichoderma, naturally degrade lignocellulose by using an arsenal of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes that act synergistically with biomass degradation. This work explored the genome organization of target genes of Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma harzianum that are able to promote hydrolysis by identifying regions enriched in degradative enzyme-encoding genes, namely, hydrolytic clusters. We employed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) methodology to target specific genomic regions to explore their genetic organization, proximal gene context, and gene expression under degradative conditions. Using this tool, it was possible to inspect the linear structure and expression data of target hydrolytic-rich genomic regions. The results offered a genomic perspective of the organization of genome regions related to carbohydrate metabolism, revealing novel genome regions and genes that are positively regulated during cellulose degradation and contributing to elucidating differences in gene organization among Trichoderma species.","['lignocellulolytic', 'gene', 'trichoderma', 'harzianum', 'atroviride', 'biorefineries', 'enzymes', 'fungi', 'hydrolysis', 'enzyme', 'genomics']",,2024-06-26,,,,,,,,cc_by_nd,
T cell receptor-centric perspective to multimodal single-cell data analysis.,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) carries critical information regarding T-cell functionality. The TCR, despite its importance, is underutilized in single cell transcriptomics, with gene expression (GEx) features solely driving current analysis strategies. Here, we argue for a switch to a TCR-first approach, which would uncover unprecedented insights into T cell and TCR repertoire mechanics. To this end, we curated a large T-cell atlas from 12 prominent human studies, containing in total 500,000 T cells spanning multiple diseases, including melanoma, head-and-neck cancer, T-cell cancer, and lung transplantation. Herein, we identified severe limitations in cell-type annotation using unsupervised approaches and propose a more robust standard using a semi-supervised method or the TCR arrangement. We then showcase the utility of a TCR-first approach through application of the novel STEGO.R tool for the successful identification of hyperexpanded clones to reveal treatment-specific changes. Additionally, a meta-analysis based on neighbor enrichment revealed previously unknown public T-cell clusters with potential antigen-specific properties as well as highlighting additional common TCR arrangements. Therefore, this paradigm shift to a TCR-first with STEGO.R highlights T-cell features often overlooked by conventional GEx-focused methods, and enabled identification of T cell features that have the potential for improvements in immunotherapy and diagnostics.","['receptor', 'cell', 'multimodal', 'data', 'analysis', 'cancer', 'transcriptomics', 'immunotherapy', 'antigen', 'gene', 'bioinformatics']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Study-Phase Reinstatement: Encoding Spontaneous Thoughts as Memories,"Can the brain improve the retrievability of an experience after it has occurred? Systems consolidation theory proposes that item-specific cortical reactivation during extended post-encoding rest periods facilitates the formation of stable memory representations, a prediction supported by neural evidence in humans [1, 2]and animals [3, 4]. Such reactivation may also occur on short time scales as spontaneous thoughts come to mind during encoding, offering a potential account of classic list memory phenomena [5-9] but lacking in support from neural data. Leveraging the high-temporal specificity of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), we investigate spontaneous reactivation of previously experienced items during brief sub-second intervals between individual encoding events. Across two large-scale free recall experiments, we show that reactivation, as measured by spectral iEEG similarity, during these periods predicts subsequent recall. In a third experiment, we show that the same methodology can identify post-encoding reactivation that correlates with subsequent memory, consistent with previous results. Thus, spontaneous study-phase reinstatement reliably predicts memory behavior, linking psychological accounts to neural mechanisms and providing the first such evidence for rapid consolidation processes during encoding.","['memories', 'encoding', 'thoughts', 'reinstatement', 'study', 'electroencephalography', 'retrievability', 'neural', 'psychological', 'reinstatement', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
A dynamic link between respiration and arousal,"Viewing brain function through the lense of other physiological processes has critically added to our understanding of human cognition. Further advances though may need a closer look at the interactions between these physiological processes themselves. Here we characterise the interplay of the highly periodic, and metabolically vital respiratory process and fluctuations in arousal neuromodulation, a process classically seen as non-periodic. In data of three experiments (N = 56 / 27 / 25) we tested for covariations in respiratory and pupil size (arousal) dynamics. After substantiating a robust coupling in the largest dataset, we further show that coupling strength decreases during task performance compared with rest, and that it mirrors a decreased respiratory rate when participants take deeper breaths. Taken together, these findings suggest a stronger link between respiratory and arousal processes than previously thought. Moreover, these links imply a stronger coupling during periods of rest, and the effect of respiratory rate on the coupling suggests a driving role. As a consequence, studying the role of neuromodulatory arousal on cortical function may also need to consider respiratory influences.","['arousal', 'dynamic', 'respiration', 'link', 'neuromodulation', 'neuromodulatory', 'studying', 'covariations', 'cognition', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Delivery of A Jagged1-PEG-MAL hydrogel with Pediatric Human Bone Cells Regenerates Critically-Sized Craniofacial Bone Defects,"Treatments for congenital and acquired craniofacial (CF) bone abnormalities are limited and expensive. Current reconstructive methods include surgical correction of injuries, short-term bone stabilization, and long-term use of bone grafting solutions, including implantation of (i) allografts which are prone to implant failure or infection, (ii) autografts which are limited in supply. Current bone regenerative approaches have consistently relied on BMP2 application with or without addition of stem cells. BMP2 treatment can lead to severe bony overgrowth or uncontrolled inflammation, which can accelerate further bone loss. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell-based treatments, which do not have the side effects of BMP2, are not currently FDA approved, and are time and resource intensive. There is a critical need for novel bone regenerative therapies to treat CF bone loss that have minimal side effects, are easily available, and are affordable. In this study we investigated novel bone regenerative therapies downstream of JAGGED1 (JAG1).

We previously demonstrated that JAG1 induces murine cranial neural crest (CNC) cells towards osteoblast commitment via a NOTCH non-canonical pathway involving JAK2-STAT5 (1) and that JAG1 delivery with CNC cells elicits bone regeneration in vivo. In this study, we hypothesize that delivery of JAG1 and induction of its downstream NOTCH non-canonical signaling in pediatric human osteoblasts constitute an effective bone regenerative treatment in an in vivo murine bone loss model of a critically-sized cranial defect. Using this CF defect model in vivo, we delivered JAG1 with pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like (HBO) cells to demonstrate the osteo-inductive properties of JAG1 in human cells and in vitro we utilized the HBO cells to identify the downstream non-canonical JAG1 signaling intermediates as effective bone regenerative treatments. In vitro, we identified an important mechanism by which JAG1 induces pediatric osteoblast commitment and bone formation involving the phosphorylation of p70 S6K. This discovery enables potential new treatment avenues involving the delivery of tethered JAG1 and the downstream activators of p70 S6K as powerful bone regenerative therapies in pediatric CF bone loss.","['craniofacial', 'pediatric', 'bone', 'hydrogel', 'regenerates', 'surgical', 'osteoblast', 'injuries', 'osteoblasts', 'expensive', 'developmental biology']",,2024-06-20,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
Elucidating Compound Mechanism of Action and Polypharmacology with a Large-scale Perturbational Profile Compendium,"The Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug is generally represented as a small, non-tissue-specific repertoire of high-affinity binding targets. Yet, drug activity and polypharmacology are increasingly associated with a broad range of off-target and tissue-specific effector proteins. To address this challenge, we have implemented an efficient integrative experimental and computational framework leveraging the systematic generation and analysis of drug perturbational profiles representing >700 FDA-approved and experimental oncology drugs, in cell lines selected as high-fidelity models of 23 aggressive tumor subtypes. Protein activity-based analyses revealed highly reproducible, drug-mediated modulation of tissue-specific targets, leading to generation of a proteome-wide polypharmacology map, characterization of MoA-related drug clusters and off-target effects, and identification and experimental validation of novel, tissue-specific inhibitors of undruggable oncoproteins. The proposed framework, which is easily extended to elucidating the MoA of novel small-molecule libraries, could help support more systematic and quantitative approaches to precision oncology.","['polypharmacology', 'elucidating', 'perturbational', 'compendium', 'profile', 'polypharmacology', 'tumor', 'oncology', 'fda', 'proteins', 'systems biology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
Computational modeling establishes mechanotransduction as a potent modulatory cue for the mammalian circadian clock,"Mechanotransduction, which is the integration of mechanical signals from the cell's external environment to changes in intracellular signaling, governs many cellular functions. Recent studies show that the mechanical state of the cell is also coupled to the cellular circadian clock. To investigate possible interactions between circadian rhythms and cellular mechanotransduction, we developed a computational model that integrates the two pathways. We postulated that translocation of the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ and MRTF into the nucleus leads to altered expression of circadian proteins. Simulations from our model predict that lower levels of cytoskeletal activity are associated with longer circadian oscillation periods and higher oscillation amplitudes, consistent with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, accumulation of YAP/TAZ and MRTF in the nucleus causes circadian oscillations to decay. These effects hold both at the single-cell level and within a population-level framework. Finally, we investigated the effects of mutations in YAP or lamin A, the latter of which lead to a class of diseases known as laminopathies. Oscillations in circadian proteins are substantially weaker in populations of cells with in silico mutations in YAP or lamin A, suggesting that defects in mechanotransduction can disrupt the circadian clock in certain disease states. However, by reducing substrate stiffness, we were able to restore normal oscillatory behavior, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism. Thus our study identifies that mechanotransduction could be a potent modulatory cue for cellular clocks and this crosstalk can be leveraged to rescue the circadian clock in disease states.","['mammalian', 'mechanotransduction', 'computational', 'modulatory', 'clock', 'mechanotransduction', 'transcriptional', 'computational', 'cellular', 'proteins', 'systems biology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by,
Vitamin auxotrophies shape microbial community assembly in the ocean,"Microbial community assembly is governed by trophic interactions that mediate the transfer of carbon sources and biomass building blocks between species. However, central metabolism corresponds to only a small fraction of the biosynthetic potential of microbes: metabolites such as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and co-factors are underexplored forces shaping microbial communities. Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","['ocean', 'microbial', 'vitamin', 'community', 'auxotrophies', 'microbial', 'bacterial', 'microbes', 'antimicrobial', 'biosynthetic', 'microbiology']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc_nd,
The guide RNA sequence dictates the slicing kinetics and conformational dynamics of the Argonaute silencing complex,"SUMMARYThe RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which powers RNA interference (RNAi), consists of a guide RNA and an Argonaute protein that slices target RNAs complementary to the guide. We find that for different guide-RNA sequences, slicing rates of perfectly complementary, bound targets can be surprisingly different (>250-fold range), and that faster slicing confers better knockdown in cells. Nucleotide sequence identities at guide-RNA positions 7, 10, and 17 underlie much of this variation in slicing rates. Analysis of one of these determinants implicates a structural distortion at guide nucleotides 6-7 in promoting slicing. Moreover, slicing directed by different guide sequences has an unanticipated, 600-fold range in 3'-mismatch tolerance, attributable to guides with weak (AU-rich) central pairing requiring extensive 3' complementarity (pairing beyond position 16) to more fully populate the slicing-competent conformation. Together, our analyses identify sequence determinants of RISC activity and provide biochemical and conformational rationale for their action.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LISequence of guide RNA can alter slicing rate of fully paired substrate by 250-fold

Quantification of escape from X chromosome inactivation with single-cell omics datasets reveals heterogeneity across cell types and tissues,"One of the two X chromosomes of females is silenced through X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to compensate for the difference in the dosage between sexes. Among the X-linked genes, several genes escape from XCI, which could contribute to the differential gene expression between the sexes. However, the differences in the escape across cell types and tissues are still poorly characterized because no methods could directly evaluate the escape under a physiological condition at the cell-cluster resolution with versatile technology. Here, we developed a method, single-cell Level inactivated X chromosome mapping (scLinaX), which directly quantifies relative gene expression from the inactivated X chromosome with droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The scLinaX and differentially expressed genes analyses with the scRNA-seq datasets of [~]1,000,000 blood cells consistently identified the relatively strong degree of escape in lymphocytes compared to myeloid cells. An extension of scLinaX for multi-modal datasets, scLinaX-multi, suggested a stronger degree of escape in lymphocytes than myeloid cells at the chromatin-accessibility level with a 10X multiome dataset. The scLinaX analysis with the human multiple-organ scRNA-seq datasets also identified the relatively strong degree of escape from XCI in lymphoid tissues and lymphocytes. Finally, effect size comparisons of genome-wide association studies between sexes identified the larger effect sizes of the PRKX gene locus-lymphocyte counts association in females than males. This could suggest evidence of the underlying impact of escape on the genotype-phenotype association in humans. Overall, scLinaX and the quantified catalog of escape identified the heterogeneity of escape across cell types and tissues and would contribute to expanding the current understanding of the XCI, escape, and sex differences in gene regulation.","['chromosome', 'heterogeneity', 'cell', 'datasets', 'tissues', 'myeloid', 'lymphoid', 'chromosomes', 'lymphocytes', 'lymphocyte', 'genomics']",,2024-06-24,,,,,,,,cc_by_nc,
The dynamics and longevity of circulating CD4+ memory T cells depend on cell age and not the chronological age of the host,"Quantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4+ effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, established fate-mapping systems, a novel reporter mouse strain, and mathematical models. Together, these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4+ T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We show that that these cells and their descendents become more persistent the longer they reside within the TCM and TEM pools. This behaviour may limit memory CD4 T cell diversity by skewing TCR repertoires towards clones generated early in life, but may also compensate for functional defects in new memory cells generated in old age.

Author summaryOur long-term protection against infections depends in part on the maintenance of diverse populations of memory CD4 T cells, which are made in response to the initial exposure to the pathogen or a vaccine. These cells are not long-lived, but instead are maintained dynamically at a clonal level through loss and division. Understanding how immune memory persists therefore requires measuring these rates of these processes, and how they might change with age. Here we combine experiments in mice with mathematical models to show that memory CD4 T cells exhibit complex dynamics but increase their capacity to survive as they age. This dynamic implies that as individuals age, their memory CD4 T cell populations become enriched for older clones. This established memory may compensate for functional defects in new T cell responses generated later in life.","['longevity', 'cell', 'cells', 'cd4', 'chronological', 'dna', 'vaccine', 'mathematical', 'mice', 'aging', 'immunology']",,2024-06-25,,,,,,,,cc_by,
A dynamic scale-mixture model of motion in natural scenes,"Some of the most important tasks of visual and motor systems involve estimating the motion of objects and tracking them over time. Such systems evolved to meet the behavioral needs of the organism in its natural environment, and may therefore be adapted to the statistics of motion it is likely to encounter. By tracking the movement of individual points in movies of natural scenes, we begin to identify common properties of natural motion across scenes. As expected, objects in natural scenes move in a persistent fashion, with velocity correlations lasting hundreds of milliseconds. More subtly, but crucially, we find that the observed velocity distributions are heavy-tailed and can be modeled as a Gaussian scale-mixture. Extending this model to the time domain leads to a dynamic scale-mixture model, consisting of a Gaussian process multiplied by a positive scalar quantity with its own independent dynamics. Dynamic scaling of velocity arises naturally as a consequence of changes in object distance from the observer, and may approximate the effects of changes in other parameters governing the motion in a given scene. This modeling and estimation framework has implications for the neurobiology of sensory and motor systems, which need to cope with these fluctuations in scale in order to represent motion efficiently and drive fast and accurate tracking behavior.","['motion', 'scenes', 'natural', 'dynamic', 'scale', 'neurobiology', 'fast', 'behavioral', 'important', 'tracking', 'neuroscience']",,2024-06-27,,,,,,,,cc_no,
