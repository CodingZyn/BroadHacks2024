Hybrid protein language models for fitness prediction and design	The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems. However, their performance has not yet matched that of their alignment-based counterparts. This talk will introduce hybrid strategies to leverage the strengths from both model classes	biotherapeutic fitness hybrid protein design proteins hard prediction massive mia meeting		2019-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/fitness-models-and-modeling-pandemic-evolution		Pascal Notin	368	0
Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses. Using EVEscape we forecast future SARS-CoV-2 evolution and present a novel and proactive approach for evaluating  and designing vaccines.	antibodies viruses future vaccine prediction antibody vaccines viral mia meeting		2019-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/using-past-predict-future-unsupervised-early-warning-viral-antibody-escape-design-and-testing		Noor Youssef, Sarah Faye Gurev	369	0
Accurate proteome-wide missense variant effect prediction with Alpha Missens	The vast majority of missense variants observed in the human genome are of unknown clinical significance. We present Alpha Missense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.	proteome genes genome alpha missense accurate genetic prediction pathogenicity pathogenic mia meeting		2019-03-13										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/alpha-missense		Žiga Avsec	371	0

Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2019-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0
Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping. We first propose Poisson thinning, which splits a single observation drawn from a Poisson distribution into two independent pseudo-observations. We show that Poisson count splitting allows us to avoid double dipping in unsupervised settings. We next generalize the Poisson thinning framework to a variety of distributions, and refer to this general framework as ""data thinning"". Data thinning is applicable far beyond the context of single-cell RNA sequencing data, and is particularly useful for problems where sample splitting is unattractive or impossible."	statistical data avoid sequencing sample double thinning dipping mia meeting		2019-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/data-thinning-avoid-double-dipping		Lucy Gao	374	0
SPLASH unifies genomic analysis and discovery through a paradigm shift to statistics-first	Myriad mechanisms diversify the sequence content of DNA and of RNA transcripts. Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run. A snapshot of its findings include new insights into RNA splicing, cancer transcriptomes, single cell RNA-editing, mobile genetic elements and discovers new genes non-model organisms.	genome cancer statistics bioinformatic splash genomic genetic paradigm discovery dna mia meeting		2019-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-11		Julia Salzman	376	0
Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2019-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0
Single-cell models for state-dependent eQTL analysis	As single-cell RNA-seq datasets grow larger and more complex, they enable richer analyses of how gene expression varies between cells and people. However, methods designed for bulk data fail to account for the unique structure of single-cell gene expression. Researchers are now developing statistical models tailored to single-cell-resolution data for a variety of applications. In this primer, I will focus on single-cell models for the task of mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to find genetic variants associated with a gene's expression. Single-cell eQTL models have the potential to capture disease-relevant, state-dependent regulatory effects with the right statistical models and representations of cell state. This primer will discuss the evolution of statistical models for eQTL mapping from pseudobulk to single-cell resolution, representations of single-cell states for state-dependent analyses, and outstanding computational challenges.	analysis state researchers disease computational genetic eqtl rna single cell mia meeting		2019-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-8		Aparna Nathan	377	0
Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2019-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0
Protein language models learn evolutionary statistics of interacting sequence motifs	Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.	statistics protein learn study biophysics analyses prediction evolutionary language mia meeting		2019-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-structure-prediction-tbd		Sergey Ovchinnikov	379	0
Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2019-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0
Protein Design with Deep Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Next Steps	The human proteome comprises tens of thousands of proteins, each tailored for a specific function by the selective pressures of evolution. The field of protein design seeks to develop proteins with new or enhanced functions at will, ultimately bypassing the evolutionary clock. In this talk, we discuss general machine-learning methods for accelerating the crucial components of protein design, with a particular focus on the underlying models. We begin with an overview of the protein design field and discuss traditional approaches. We then focus on two important subtasks, fixed-backbone design and protein-protein docking, and critique deep learning approaches with an emphasis on the modeling considerations that attribute to their success. Finally, we highlight some limitations and outstanding challenges in the field and potential next steps.	proteome protein challenges deep design proteins evolution evolutionary learning mia meeting		2019-05-08										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-design-deep-learning-progress-challenges-and-next-steps		Matthew McPartlon	381	0
Unlocking Generative AI for Drug Discovery with Zero-shot Models	Generative AI has the potential to greatly incrase the speed, quality, and controllability of drug design. Traditional discovery requires time and resource intensive screening of large libraries, which also offer little control on the output molecules, which can result in suboptimal candidates. Here, we show how generative deep learning models can produce molecules and representations that could be used for downstream design of new molecules with specified functions.	intensive learning unlocking screening models drug libraries generative discovery mia meeting		2019-05-08										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-10		Joshua Meier	382	0
Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce. We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2019-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2019-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0

Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run. A snapshot of its findings include new insights into RNA splicing, cancer transcriptomes, single cell RNA-editing, mobile genetic elements and discovers new genes non-model organisms.	genome cancer statistics bioinformatic splash genomic genetic paradigm discovery dna mia meeting		2020-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-11		Julia Salzman	376	0
Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2020-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0

Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2020-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0

Single-cell models for state-dependent eQTL analysis	As single-cell RNA-seq datasets grow larger and more complex, they enable richer analyses of how gene expression varies between cells and people. However, methods designed for bulk data fail to account for the unique structure of single-cell gene expression. Researchers are now developing statistical models tailored to single-cell-resolution data for a variety of applications. In this primer, I will focus on single-cell models for the task of mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to find genetic variants associated with a gene's expression. Single-cell eQTL models have the potential to capture disease-relevant, state-dependent regulatory effects with the right statistical models and representations of cell state. This primer will discuss the evolution of statistical models for eQTL mapping from pseudobulk to single-cell resolution, representations of single-cell states for state-dependent analyses, and outstanding computational challenges.	analysis state researchers disease computational genetic eqtl rna single cell mia meeting		2020-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-8		Aparna Nathan	377	0

Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2020-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0
Protein language models learn evolutionary statistics of interacting sequence motifs	Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.	statistics protein learn study biophysics analyses prediction evolutionary language mia meeting		2020-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-structure-prediction-tbd		Sergey Ovchinnikov	379	0

Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce. We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2020-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2020-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0

Hybrid protein language models for fitness prediction and design	The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems. However, their performance has not yet matched that of their alignment-based counterparts.

Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses. Using EVEscape we forecast future SARS-CoV-2 evolution and present a novel and proactive approach for evaluating  and designing vaccines.	antibodies viruses future vaccine prediction antibody vaccines viral mia meeting		2021-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/using-past-predict-future-unsupervised-early-warning-viral-antibody-escape-design-and-testing		Noor Youssef, Sarah Faye Gurev	369	0

By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.	proteome genes genome alpha missense accurate genetic prediction pathogenicity pathogenic mia meeting		2021-03-13										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/alpha-missense		Žiga Avsec	371	0

Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2021-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0
Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping.

Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping. We first propose Poisson thinning, which splits a single observation drawn from a Poisson distribution into two independent pseudo-observations. We show that Poisson count splitting allows us to avoid double dipping in unsupervised settings.

Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2021-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0
Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2021-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0
SPLASH unifies genomic analysis and discovery through a paradigm shift to statistics-first	Myriad mechanisms diversify the sequence content of DNA and of RNA transcripts. Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run. A snapshot of its findings include new insights into RNA splicing, cancer transcriptomes, single cell RNA-editing, mobile genetic elements and discovers new genes non-model organisms.	genome cancer statistics bioinformatic splash genomic genetic paradigm discovery dna mia meeting		2021-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-11		Julia Salzman	376	0

Single-cell models for state-dependent eQTL analysis	As single-cell RNA-seq datasets grow larger and more complex, they enable richer analyses of how gene expression varies between cells and people. However, methods designed for bulk data fail to account for the unique structure of single-cell gene expression. Researchers are now developing statistical models tailored to single-cell-resolution data for a variety of applications. In this primer, I will focus on single-cell models for the task of mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to find genetic variants associated with a gene's expression. Single-cell eQTL models have the potential to capture disease-relevant, state-dependent regulatory effects with the right statistical models and representations of cell state. This primer will discuss the evolution of statistical models for eQTL mapping from pseudobulk to single-cell resolution, representations of single-cell states for state-dependent analyses, and outstanding computational challenges.	analysis state researchers disease computational genetic eqtl rna single cell mia meeting		2021-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-8		Aparna Nathan	377	0

Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2021-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0

Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2021-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0

Protein language models learn evolutionary statistics of interacting sequence motifs	Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.	statistics protein learn study biophysics analyses prediction evolutionary language mia meeting		2021-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-structure-prediction-tbd		Sergey Ovchinnikov	379	0

Protein Design with Deep Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Next Steps	The human proteome comprises tens of thousands of proteins, each tailored for a specific function by the selective pressures of evolution.

In this talk, we discuss general machine-learning methods for accelerating the crucial components of protein design, with a particular focus on the underlying models. We begin with an overview of the protein design field and discuss traditional approaches. We then focus on two important subtasks, fixed-backbone design and protein-protein docking, and critique deep learning approaches with an emphasis on the modeling considerations that attribute to their success.

Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce. We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2021-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2021-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0

Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses. Using EVEscape we forecast future SARS-CoV-2 evolution and present a novel and proactive approach for evaluating  and designing vaccines.	antibodies viruses future vaccine prediction antibody vaccines viral mia meeting		2022-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/using-past-predict-future-unsupervised-early-warning-viral-antibody-escape-design-and-testing		Noor Youssef, Sarah Faye Gurev	369	0

Hybrid protein language models for fitness prediction and design	The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems.

We present Alpha Missense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.	proteome genes genome alpha missense accurate genetic prediction pathogenicity pathogenic mia meeting		2022-03-13										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/alpha-missense		Žiga Avsec	371	0

We present Alpha Missense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect.

Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2022-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0
Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping. We first propose Poisson thinning, which splits a single observation drawn from a Poisson distribution into two independent pseudo-observations. We show that Poisson count splitting allows us to avoid double dipping in unsupervised settings. We next generalize the Poisson thinning framework to a variety of distributions, and refer to this general framework as ""data thinning"". Data thinning is applicable far beyond the context of single-cell RNA sequencing data, and is particularly useful for problems where sample splitting is unattractive or impossible."	statistical data avoid sequencing sample double thinning dipping mia meeting		2022-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/data-thinning-avoid-double-dipping		Lucy Gao	374	0

SPLASH unifies genomic analysis and discovery through a paradigm shift to statistics-first	Myriad mechanisms diversify the sequence content of DNA and of RNA transcripts. Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run.

Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2022-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0

Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2022-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0

Protein language models learn evolutionary statistics of interacting sequence motifs	Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.	statistics protein learn study biophysics analyses prediction evolutionary language mia meeting		2022-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-structure-prediction-tbd		Sergey Ovchinnikov	379	0
Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2022-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0

Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce. We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2022-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2022-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0

Hybrid protein language models for fitness prediction and design	The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems. However, their performance has not yet matched that of their alignment-based counterparts.

Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses.

Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems. However, their performance has not yet matched that of their alignment-based counterparts. This talk will introduce hybrid strategies to leverage the strengths from both model classes	biotherapeutic fitness hybrid protein design proteins hard prediction massive mia meeting		2023-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/fitness-models-and-modeling-pandemic-evolution		Pascal Notin	368	0
Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses. Using EVEscape we forecast future SARS-CoV-2 evolution and present a novel and proactive approach for evaluating  and designing vaccines.	antibodies viruses future vaccine prediction antibody vaccines viral mia meeting		2023-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/using-past-predict-future-unsupervised-early-warning-viral-antibody-escape-design-and-testing		Noor Youssef, Sarah Faye Gurev	369	0
Alpha Missens	The vast majority of missense variants observed in the human genome are of unknown clinical significance. We present Alpha Missense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.	genes genome alpha missens genetic pathogenicity pathogenic mia meeting		2023-03-13										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/alpha-missense-0		Jun Cheng	372	0

Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping. We first propose Poisson thinning, which splits a single observation drawn from a Poisson distribution into two independent pseudo-observations. We show that Poisson count splitting allows us to avoid double dipping in unsupervised settings. We next generalize the Poisson thinning framework to a variety of distributions, and refer to this general framework as ""data thinning"". Data thinning is applicable far beyond the context of single-cell RNA sequencing data, and is particularly useful for problems where sample splitting is unattractive or impossible."	statistical data avoid sequencing sample double thinning dipping mia meeting		2023-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/data-thinning-avoid-double-dipping		Lucy Gao	374	0
Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2023-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0

Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2023-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0
SPLASH unifies genomic analysis and discovery through a paradigm shift to statistics-first	Myriad mechanisms diversify the sequence content of DNA and of RNA transcripts. Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run.

Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2023-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0

Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2023-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0

However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts.

Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce. We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2023-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2023-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0

We conclude with an outlook for the future with “AI scientists” as generative agents capable of skeptical learning and reasoning to empower biomedical research.	function scientists deciphering protein biomedical multimodal proteins molecular language mia meeting		2023-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/multimodal-protein-language-models-deciphering-protein-function		Owen Queen, Yepeng Huang, Marinka Zitnik	384	0
Geometric deep learning and generative models for protein target discovery	Computational therapeutic target discovery requires deciphering the cell types in which proteins act and their interactions. We present PINNACLE, a contextual AI model for single-cell protein biology. Using a multi-organ single-cell atlas, PINNACLE learns from contextualized protein interaction networks, producing 394,760 protein representations from 156 cell types across 24 tissues. PINNACLE’s embedding space reflects cellular and tissue organization, enabling zero-shot retrieval of tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PINNACLE representations can power a range of tasks: enhancing 3D structure-based representations in immuno-oncology, predicting drug effects across cell types and states, and identifying therapeutic targets in a cell-type-specific manner. We used PINNACLE to nominate protein targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying predictive cell type contexts. Drugs bind to protein pockets, areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, a challenging task due to biomolecular interactions and sequence-structure dependencies. We developed PocketGen, a sequence-structure generative model that optimizes protein pockets to serve as optimal binders for ligand molecules. PocketGen iteratively refines the sequence and structure of pockets by maximizing binding affinity with the ligand and sequence-structure consistency. Using a graph transformer for all-atom structure modeling and a protein language model for sequence prediction, PocketGen can help optimize protein pockets with high binding affinity, strong structural validity and generation efficiency.	oncology protein learning biology biomolecular proteins geometric generative discovery mia meeting		2023-05-29										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-7		Marinka Zitnik	383	0
Hybrid protein language models for fitness prediction and design	The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families seek to address these problems. However, their performance has not yet matched that of their alignment-based counterparts. This talk will introduce hybrid strategies to leverage the strengths from both model classes	biotherapeutic fitness hybrid protein design proteins hard prediction massive mia meeting		2024-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/fitness-models-and-modeling-pandemic-evolution		Pascal Notin	368	0
Unsupervised viral antibody escape prediction for future-proof vaccines	Effective pandemic preparedness relies on predicting immune-evasive viral mutations to ensure early detection of variants of concern and to design future-proofed vaccines and therapeutics. However, current experimental strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic since  they require host polyclonal antibodies.  Furthermore, the existing paradigm for vaccine evaluation relies on retrospective evaluation against past variants, instead of proactive evaluation against future viral evolution. To address these limitations, we developed EVEscape, a model which integrated fitness predictions from evolutionary models, structure-based features that assess antibody binding potential, and biochemical distances between mutated and wild-type residues. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans, or 3D structures of antibody complexes are available. Using only information available pre-pandemic, EVEscape is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses. Using EVEscape we forecast future SARS-CoV-2 evolution and present a novel and proactive approach for evaluating  and designing vaccines.	antibodies viruses future vaccine prediction antibody vaccines viral mia meeting		2024-02-14										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/using-past-predict-future-unsupervised-early-warning-viral-antibody-escape-design-and-testing		Noor Youssef, Sarah Faye Gurev	369	0
Accurate proteome-wide missense variant effect prediction with Alpha Missens	The vast majority of missense variants observed in the human genome are of unknown clinical significance. We present Alpha Missense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.	proteome genes genome alpha missense accurate genetic prediction pathogenicity pathogenic mia meeting		2024-03-13										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/alpha-missense		Žiga Avsec	371	0

Testing data-driven hypotheses post-clustering	This primer talk is motivated by the practice of testing data-driven hypotheses. In the biomedical sciences, it has become increasingly common to collect massive datasets without a pre-specified research question. In this setting, a data analyst might use the data both to generate a research question, and to test the associated null hypothesis. For example, in single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, researchers often first cluster the cells, and then test for differences in the expected gene expression levels between the clusters to quantify up- or down-regulation of genes, annotate known cell types, and identify new cell types. However, this popular practice is invalid from a statistical perspective: once we have used the data to generate hypotheses, standard statistical inference tools are no longer valid. To tackle this problem, I developed a conditional selective approach to test for a difference in means between pairs of clusters obtained via hierarchical and k-means clustering. The proposed approach has appropriate statistical guarantees (e.g., selective Type 1 error control), and we demonstrate its use on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	genes data research post biomedical researchers clustering rna testing hypotheses mia meeting		2024-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/valid-hypothesis-testing-after-clustering-0		Yiqun Chen	373	0
Data thinning to avoid double dipping	"""Double dipping"" is the practice of using the same data to fit and validate a model. Problems typically arise when standard statistical procedures are applied in settings involving double dipping. To avoid the challenges surrounding double dipping, a natural approach is to fit a model on one dataset, and then validate the model on another independent dataset. When we only have access to one dataset, we typically accomplish this via sample splitting. Unfortunately, in some problems, sample splitting is unattractive or impossible. In this talk, we are motivated by unsupervised problems that arise in the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data, where sample splitting does not allow us to avoid double dipping. We first propose Poisson thinning, which splits a single observation drawn from a Poisson distribution into two independent pseudo-observations. We show that Poisson count splitting allows us to avoid double dipping in unsupervised settings. We next generalize the Poisson thinning framework to a variety of distributions, and refer to this general framework as ""data thinning"". Data thinning is applicable far beyond the context of single-cell RNA sequencing data, and is particularly useful for problems where sample splitting is unattractive or impossible."	statistical data avoid sequencing sample double thinning dipping mia meeting		2024-03-20										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/data-thinning-avoid-double-dipping		Lucy Gao	374	0
SPLASH unifies genomic analysis and discovery through a paradigm shift to statistics-first	Myriad mechanisms diversify the sequence content of DNA and of RNA transcripts. Currently, these events are detected using tools that first require alignment to a necessarily incomplete reference genome alignment in the first step; this incompleteness is especially prominent in human genetic diseases such as cancer, in the microbial world, and in non—model organisms where it severely limits the speed and scope of discovery. Second, today the next step in analysis requires as a custom choice of bioinformatic procedure to follow it: for example, to detect splicing, RNA editing, or V(D)J recombination among many others.  I will present the theory for why SPLASH, a new statistics-first analytic approach captures myriad forms of genome regulation, without a reference or sample metadata, by performing statistical inference directly on raw sequencing reads. By design, SPLASH as an algorithm is highly efficient. Thanks to joint work with Professor Sebastian Deorowicz’s group, SPLASH is now implemented so that it is efficient and simple to run. A snapshot of its findings include new insights into RNA splicing, cancer transcriptomes, single cell RNA-editing, mobile genetic elements and discovers new genes non-model organisms.	genome cancer statistics bioinformatic splash genomic genetic paradigm discovery dna mia meeting		2024-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-11		Julia Salzman	376	0
Statistical and algorithmic challenges in reference-free analysis	Today’s genomics workflows typically begin by aligning sequencing data to a reference. In addition to being slow, this has many statistical drawbacks. Even in the intensely studied human genome, it was found that understudied populations have large amounts of sequence missing from the current reference; such blind spots may exacerbate health disparities. Reference-based methods are additionally limited in their detection of novel biology: reads from unannotated isoforms may be mismapped or discarded completely. In recent work we introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH, which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale, providing a unifying statistical approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references. In this primer I’ll discuss some of the challenges of reference-free analysis, and provide the algorithmic and statistical background for our proposed solution, SPLASH.	statistical drawbacks genomics reference exacerbate algorithmic challenges biology genomic analysis mia meeting		2024-04-03										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-12		Tavor Baharav	375	0
Single-cell models for state-dependent eQTL analysis	As single-cell RNA-seq datasets grow larger and more complex, they enable richer analyses of how gene expression varies between cells and people. However, methods designed for bulk data fail to account for the unique structure of single-cell gene expression. Researchers are now developing statistical models tailored to single-cell-resolution data for a variety of applications. In this primer, I will focus on single-cell models for the task of mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to find genetic variants associated with a gene's expression. Single-cell eQTL models have the potential to capture disease-relevant, state-dependent regulatory effects with the right statistical models and representations of cell state. This primer will discuss the evolution of statistical models for eQTL mapping from pseudobulk to single-cell resolution, representations of single-cell states for state-dependent analyses, and outstanding computational challenges.	analysis state researchers disease computational genetic eqtl rna single cell mia meeting		2024-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-8		Aparna Nathan	377	0
Scalable single-cell models for robust cell-state-dependent eQTL mapping	Modelling cell state-dependent genetic associations with single-cell gene expression exhibits statistical and computational challenges. First, parametrization of single-cell gene expression profiles is not a straightforward task because individual genes exhibit distinct distributions. Second, current single-cell datasets consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells, which constrains the ability to test associations in a scalable manner. In this talk, I will introduce a new generalizable approach to robustly identify cell state-dependent eQTLs in single-cell data. To overcome the challenge of gene expression parametrization, we implemented a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to compute empirically calibrated p-values for variant-gene expression associations. To speed up the computation, we used the Julia programming language and pre-computed covariate-adjusted gene expression profiles with a linear mixed model before testing cell state-dependent eQTL interactions. Finally, I will demonstrate an application of this approach to identify autoimmune disease risk loci with context-specific effects in memory T cells.	genes autoimmune scalable computation mapping computational genetic eqtl robust cell mia meeting		2024-04-10										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-9		Jose Alquicira-Hernandez	378	0
Protein language models learn evolutionary statistics of interacting sequence motifs	Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any pLM, allowing us to compare coevolutionary statistics to linear models. We further identified that ESM-2 does not require full context for predicting inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.	statistics protein learn study biophysics analyses prediction evolutionary language mia meeting		2024-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-structure-prediction-tbd		Sergey Ovchinnikov	379	0
Combining protein language and structure models to redesign E. coli proteome with a reduced amino acid alphabet	All known organisms need all 20 canonical amino acids to survive and reproduce, yet use of different amino acids must’ve evolved over time. Unfortunately, even the last universal common ancestor used all 20, so there is no way to observe how life might have looked without all of them. Here, we’re trying to synthesize such an organism by designing a strain of E. coli using only 19 canonical amino acids, starting from redesigning essential genes one at a time with the goal of preserving fitness. Since there are many diverse genes to design, we’re repurposing and extending machine learning-driven protein design methods to accomplish this task. Each of the currently available methods is capturing specific properties of the design landscape due to its approach and training data provided to the models. Protein language models like ESM have access to a vast number of sequences and can learn patterns favored by nature. Methods using AlphaFold as a loss function like AFDesign or MCMC hallucination are aware of the final structure of the protein, but are susceptible to adversarial examples. Finally, models which perform “inverse folding” like ProteinMPNN have both sequence and structure information and can output structure-aware designs. We’re developing optimization methods which combine these models as part of the design process to find sequences which are scored highly by models coming from different approaches, and how this translates to their biological properties. The experimental results show that our methods can generate designs comparable with wild-type versions in fitness with a small number of attempts.	genes amino protein proteinmpnn coli redesign alphabet 20 mia meeting		2024-05-01										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/combining-protein-language-and-structure-models-redesign-e-coli-proteome-reduced-amino-acid		Simon Kozlov	380	0
Protein Design with Deep Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Next Steps	The human proteome comprises tens of thousands of proteins, each tailored for a specific function by the selective pressures of evolution. The field of protein design seeks to develop proteins with new or enhanced functions at will, ultimately bypassing the evolutionary clock. In this talk, we discuss general machine-learning methods for accelerating the crucial components of protein design, with a particular focus on the underlying models. We begin with an overview of the protein design field and discuss traditional approaches. We then focus on two important subtasks, fixed-backbone design and protein-protein docking, and critique deep learning approaches with an emphasis on the modeling considerations that attribute to their success. Finally, we highlight some limitations and outstanding challenges in the field and potential next steps.	proteome protein challenges deep design proteins evolution evolutionary learning mia meeting		2024-05-08										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/protein-design-deep-learning-progress-challenges-and-next-steps		Matthew McPartlon	381	0
Unlocking Generative AI for Drug Discovery with Zero-shot Models	Generative AI has the potential to greatly incrase the speed, quality, and controllability of drug design. Traditional discovery requires time and resource intensive screening of large libraries, which also offer little control on the output molecules, which can result in suboptimal candidates. Here, we show how generative deep learning models can produce molecules and representations that could be used for downstream design of new molecules with specified functions.	intensive learning unlocking screening models drug libraries generative discovery mia meeting		2024-05-08										https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/tbd-10		Joshua Meier	382	0

Multimodal protein language models for deciphering protein function	Understanding the relationship between a protein's amino acid sequence and its structure or function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, as the effects of drugs are often directly linked to proteins. Current protein language models (PLMs) capture evolutionary relationships based on sequences but fall short of directly acquiring protein functions from multimodal molecular data, including protein sequences and structures, peptides, and domains. We develop a multimodal protein language model that integrates textual protein descriptions with a sequence-structure PLM to create a more comprehensive and functionally insightful model of proteins. This integration promises to bridge the current gap in PLMs, transitioning from understanding the structural aspects of proteins to gaining a functional view of vast protein space. The model allows scientists to express their queries in natural language and interact with protein models in an open-ended manner. It allows for text-based prediction of protein targets, multimodal protein captioning, and Q&A sessions with scientists with varying levels of expertise, among others. Trained on a new dataset of protein-text instructions, the model can generalize to new phenotypes in a zero-shot manner, making it versatile for diverse tasks even when functional annotations are scarce.
