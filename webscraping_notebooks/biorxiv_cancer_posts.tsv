Ras-dependent activation of BMAL2 regulates hypoxic metabolism in pancreatic cancer	To identify drivers of malignancy in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we performed regulatory network analysis on a large collection of expression profiles from laser capture microdissected samples of PDAC and benign precursors. We discovered that BMAL2 plays a role in the initiation, progression, post resection survival, and KRAS activity in PDAC. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes led us to hypothe-size that it plays a role in regulating the response to hypoxia, a critical but poorly understood feature of PDAC physiology. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines revealed effects on viability and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Loss of BMAL2 also affected glycolysis and other metabolic processes. We found that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes. We also found that BMAL2 is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A upon exposure to hypoxia, but destabilizes HIF2A under hypoxia. These data demonstrate that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC and may serve as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.  Statement of significanceWe provide a comprehensive portrait of the molecular drivers behind pancreatic cancer initiation, progression and outcome. We discover a new genetic regulator of metabolic responses to low oxygen environments, a key feature of pancreatic cancer biology. This protein, BMAL2, is a new driver of pancreatic cancer malignancy.	cancer_biology genes glycolysis pancreatic adenocarcinoma bmal2 metabolism activation cancer		2024-06-22								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/22/2023.03.19.533333.source.xml		Kenneth P Olive	5	0
Therapeutic targeting of ACLY in T-ALL in vivo	T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematological malignancy in need of novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we identify the ATP-citrate lyase ACLY as overexpressed and as a novel therapeutic target in T-ALL. To test the effects of ACLY in leukemia progression, we developed an isogenic model of NOTCH1-induced Acly conditional knockout leukemia. Importantly, we observed intrinsic antileukemic effects upon loss of ACLY, which further synergized with NOTCH1 inhibition in vivo. Metabolomic profiling upon ACLY loss revealed a metabolic crisis with reduced acetyl-CoA levels, as well as a decreased oxygen consumption rate. Gene expression profiling analyses showed that the transcriptional signature of ACLY loss very significantly correlates with the signature of MYC loss in vivo. Mechanistically, the decrease in acetyl-CoA led to reduced H3K27ac levels in Myc, resulting in transcriptional downregulation of Myc and drastically reduced MYC protein levels. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed a reciprocal relationship whereby ACLY itself is a direct transcriptional target of MYC, thus establishing a feedforward loop that is important for leukemia progression. Overall, our results identified a relevant ACLY-MYC axis and unveiled ACLY as a novel promising target for T-ALL treatment.	cancer_biology h3k27ac malignancy hematological therapeutic acly leukemia targeting vivo lymphoblastic		2024-06-20								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/20/2023.03.27.534395.source.xml		Daniel Herranz	6	0
Novel diagnosis- and progression-related microRNA signatures in melanoma	Melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer with a high mortality rate, has suffered from a recent increase in incidence; therefore, the search for biomarkers such as micro (mi)RNAs to aid the early detection and management of cancer patients represents a current concern.  To identify these potential biomarkers, we developed a novel and integrative strategy: we conducted a systematic review of melanoma studies following PRISMA guidelines and subsequently performed exploratory analysis and data normalization. Then, we performed individual analyses of each study followed by a miRNA meta-analysis that integrated all results while considering patient information.  In the diagnostic scenario, we unveiled twenty-four differentially expressed miRNAs - eleven upregulated and thirteen downregulated, with ten not previously directly related to the diagnosis of primary melanoma. In the ulceration scenario, we found twenty-three differentially expressed miRNAs - seven upregulated and sixteen downregulated, with thirteen not previously directly related to the diagnosis of primary melanoma. An extensive functional characterisation of these mirna signatures was carried out, providing insight into their biological role and impact on melanoma diagnosis and prognosis.  Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and developmental processes involved in melanoma, mainly in early-stage development and ulceration, which, in turn, offers a means to develop novel resources for precisely detecting and treating melanoma.	cancer_biology microrna melanoma biomarkers ulceration novel diagnosis cancer signatures extensive		2024-06-21								cc_by_nc		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/21/2023.10.20.563284.source.xml		Francisco Garcia-Garcia	7	0
Disruption of P2Y2 signaling promotes breast tumor cell dissemination by reducing ATP-dependent calcium elevation and actin localization to cell junctions	The tumor microenvironment and wound healing after injury both contain extremely high concentrations of the extracellular signaling molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) compared to normal tissue. P2Y2 receptor, an ATP-activated purinergic receptor, is typically associated with pulmonary, endothelial, and neurological cell signaling. Here we report its role and importance in breast epithelial cell signaling and how it is altered in metastatic breast cancer. In response to ATP activation, P2Y2 receptor signaling causes an increase of intracellular Ca2+ in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, while their tumorigenic and metastatic counterparts have significantly reduced Ca2+ responses. The non-tumorigenic cells respond to increased Ca2+ with actin polymerization and localization to cell edges, while the metastatic cells remained unaffected. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ after ATP stimulation was blunted using a P2Y2 antagonist, which also prevented actin mobilization and caused cell dissemination from spheroids in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the lack of Ca2+ concentration changes and actin mobilization in the metastatic breast cancer cells could be due to reduced P2Y2 expression, which correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. This study elucidates rapid changes that occur after elevated intracellular Ca2+ in breast epithelial cells and how metastatic cancer cells have adapted to evade this cellular response.	cancer_biology endothelial breast tumorigenic p2y2 calcium reducing cancer tumor atp		2024-06-13								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/13/2023.03.31.533191.source.xml		Makenzy L Mull	8	0
A novel Nav1.5-dependent feedback mechanism driving glycolytic acidification in breast cancer metastasis	Solid tumours have abnormally high intracellular [Na+]. The activity of various Na+ channels may underlie this Na+ accumulation. Voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) have been shown to be functionally active in cancer cell lines, where they promote invasion. However, the mechanisms involved, and clinical relevance, are incompletely understood. Here, we show that protein expression of the Nav1.5 VGSC subtype strongly correlates with increased metastasis and shortened cancer-specific survival in breast cancer patients. In addition, VGSCs are functionally active in patient-derived breast tumour cells, cell lines, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Knock down of Nav1.5 in a mouse model of breast cancer suppresses expression of invasion-regulating genes. Nav1.5 activity increases glycolysis in breast cancer cells, likely by up-regulating activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, thus promoting H+ production and extracellular acidification. The pH of murine xenograft tumours is lower at the periphery than in the core, in regions of higher proliferation and lower apoptosis. In turn, acidic extracellular pH elevates persistent Na+ influx through Nav1.5 into breast cancer cells. Together, these findings show positive feedback between extracellular acidification and movement of Na+ into cancer cells which can facilitate invasion. These results highlight the clinical significance of Nav1.5 activity as a potentiator of breast cancer metastasis and provide further evidence supporting the use of VGSC inhibitors in cancer treatment.	cancer_biology glycolysis breast tumour tumours metastasis acidification fibroblasts cancer glycolytic		2024-06-13								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/13/2023.06.16.545273.source.xml		William J Brackenbury	9	0
Deep Visual Proteomics Unveils Precision Medicine Insights in Composite Small Lymphocytic and Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma	Coexistence of two cancer types in the same organ presents challenges for clinical decision-making, calling for personalized treatment strategies. Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) combines AI driven single cell type analysis with laser microdissection and ultrasensitive mass spectrometry. In a composite case of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in a single patient, we investigated the potential of DVP to inform precision oncology. We quantified the proteomic landscapes in the cHL and SLL to a depth of thousands of proteins. Our analysis revealed distinct proteome profiles in cHL and SLL populations, highlighting their clonal unrelatedness. Our data suggested standardized chemotherapy and interleukin-4 inhibition as potential strategies to manage chemo-resistance - instead of bone marrow transplantation. DVP highlighted minichromosome maintenance protein and proteasome inhibitors for cHL and H3K27 methylation and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for SLL as subtype-specific treatments. Thus cell-type specific insights of DVP can guide personalized oncological treatments.	cancer_biology lymphoma oncology transplantation medicine hodgkin proteomics lymphocytic chemotherapy cancer		2024-06-13								cc_by_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/13/2024.06.12.598635.source.xml		Matthias Mann	10	0
KDM2B is required for ribosome biogenesis and its depletion unequally affects mRNA translation	KDM2B is a JmjC domain lysine demethylase, which promotes cell immortalization, stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Here we employed a multi-omics strategy to address its role in ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation. These processes are required to sustain cell proliferation, an important cancer hallmark. Contrary to earlier observations, KDM2B promotes ribosome biogenesis by stimulating the transcription of genes encoding ribosome biogenesis factors and ribosomal proteins, particularly those involved in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunits. Knockdown of KDM2B impaired the assembly of the small and large subunit processomes, as evidenced by specific defects in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. The final outcome was a decrease in the rate of ribosome assembly and in the abundance of ribosomes, and inhibition of mRNA translation. The inhibition of translation was distributed unequally among mRNAs with different features, suggesting that mRNA-embedded properties influence how mRNAs interpret ribosome abundance. This study identified a novel mechanism contributing to the regulation of translation and provided evidence for a rich biology elicited by a pathway that depends on KDM2B, and perhaps other regulators of translation.	cancer_biology biology tumorigenesis ribosomal biogenesis depletion mrna ribosome cancer kdm2b		2024-06-06								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/06/2024.05.22.595403.source.xml		Vollter Anastas	11	0
The Universal Breast cancer Subtyping 93 finds that claudin-low breast cancer may originate from basal breast cancer.	BackgroundBreast cancer is a complex disease with diverse molecular characteristics, significantly impacting patient prognosis, outcomes, and treatment decisions. Previous studies have introduced PAM50 classifiers and claudin-low classifiers based on bulk RNA-seq samples. However, single-cell analysis has revealed the existence of distinct subtypes within the same tumor, indicating that classifiers relying on gene signatures derived from bulk samples may not accurately capture the true molecular features of breast cancer.  MethodTo address this limitation, we utilized single-cell data from breast cancer patients to define the E-M ratio parameter. We identified 93 epithelial-specific genes and developed a Universal Breast cancer Subtyping 93 (UBS93). To validate the efficacy of UBS93, we conducted separate analyses using bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets of human breast cancer cell lines, as well as bulk RNA-seq data from mice. Additionally, we compared the performance of UBS93 with that of the genefu package to highlight its advantages.  ResultsUBS93 demonstrated excellent performance in human and mouse datasets, including bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data. It exhibited higher epithelial specificity and accuracy compared to PAM50 genes. When predicting bulk RNA-seq data from breast cancer cell lines and mouse models, UBS93 outperformed the genefu package. Single-cell validation revealed the coexistence of basal and claudin-low subtypes in the HDQP1 cell line and two TNBC patients, suggesting a shared origin. Differential gene expression analysis identified ELF3 loss as a potential driver for basal-to-claudin-low differentiation. Experimental validation confirmed that the downregulation of ELF3 resulted in the downregulation of CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN7, facilitating the transition from basal to claudin-low cells.  ConclusionOur study constructed a comprehensive breast cancer classification, UBS93, based on 93 epithelial-specific genes identified using single-cell data. By applying UBS93, we unveiled the coexistence of basal and claudin-low subtypes and illuminated the molecular mechanism underlying basal-to-claudin-low differentiation, with ELF3 loss playing a significant role in this process.  BackgroundBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in terms of molecular alterations, cellular composition, and clinical outcomes. However, this heterogeneity poses challenges regarding clinically relevant tumor classification for prognosis and prediction [36931265] [1]. Fortunately, researchers have utilized microarray technology to develop an intrinsic breast cancer classifier called PAM50, which categorizes cancer into five subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like, and Normal-like [19204204] [2]. This classification system significantly enhances the prognostic and predictive value over traditional approaches, including pathological staging, histological grading, and standard clinical biomarkers.  Through in-depth investigation of gene expression profiles in breast cancer, researchers have discovered a novel subtype characterized by low expression levels of cell adhesion components such as CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN7, and CDH1, which is associated with mesenchymal features. This new subtype exhibits increased proliferative capacity and poorer prognosis [17493263] [3]. In response, Alexi et al. developed a classification method called the nine-cell line claudin-low predictor, categorizing breast cancer into two groups: Claudin-low and Others [20813035] [4]. However, the origin of this new subtype has been a subject of ongoing debate. Some researchers suggest that the occurrence and progression of triple-negative breast cancer from luminal epithelium are driven by carcinogenic RAS signal transduction., although this conclusion has yet to be validated in human data [34145248] [5]. Another study, based on genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression analyses, found that claudin-low breast cancer originates from three subgroups, with two subgroups associated with luminal and basal-like subtypes, and the third subgroup closely related to normal human breast stem cells [32647202] [6]. In conclusion, the origin of claudin-low breast cancer is a complex process that requires further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and contributing factors.  Single-cell transcriptomic analysis has provided us with deeper insights into the heterogeneity among different subtypes of breast cancer [35352511] [7]. By analyzing the intrinsic subtypes within individual malignant cells, it has been discovered that there exist cells of different subtypes within a single tumor. This indicates that the tumor subtypes defined by gene signatures obtained through bulk RNA sequencing may not always accurately reflect the true molecular phenotype of the tumor [36931265][1]. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of tumor cells, single-cell analysis is necessary. Additionally, there is a lack of standardized prediction for breast cancer subtypes. To address these issues, we have developed a novel epithelial cell-specific prediction factor called Universal Breast Cancer Subtyping 93 (UBS93). UBS93 classifies breast cancer into four subtypes: Basal, Claudin-low, HER2-amp, and Luminal. UBS93 focuses on epithelial-specific markers and aims to provide a more consistent and comprehensive approach for breast cancer subtype classification. This advancement holds the potential to improve the accuracy of classification, facilitate personalized treatment strategies, and guide clinical decision-making.	cancer_biology genetic biomarkers breast 93 claudin carcinogenic subtyping cancer tumor		2024-06-06								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/06/2024.06.02.597060.source.xml		Jing Li	12	0
An organoid co-culture model for probing systemic anti-tumor immunity in lung cancer	"Deciphering the interactions between tumor micro- and systemic immune macro-environment is essential for developing more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies. Here, we established a gel-liquid interface (GLI) co-culture of lung cancer organoids (LCOs) and paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), featuring with enhanced interactions of immune cells and tumor organoids, to mimic the in vivo systemic anti-tumor immunity induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). The co-culture model recapitulates the in vivo ICI-induced T cell recruitment and subsequent tumor regression, predicting the clinical results precisely. We demonstrated that circulating tumor-reactive T cells, which are effector memory-like with high expression levels of GNLY, CD44 and CD9, can serve as an indicator of the immunotherapy efficacy. Interestingly, enhanced inflammatory signaling in blood T cells is accompanied with prompted exhaustion and compromised anti-tumor function, when encountering with organoids. Our findings suggest that the GLI co-culture can be used for developing diagnostic strategies for precision immunotherapies as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms.

Comprehensive single cell transcriptomics analysis of murine osteosarcoma uncovers Skp2 function in metastasis, genomic instability and immune activation and reveals additional target pathways	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary pediatric bone malignancy. One promising new therapeutic target is SKP2, encoding a substrate recognition factor of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of substrate p27, thus driving cellular proliferation. We have shown previously that knockout of Skp2 in an immunocompetent transgenic mouse model of OS improved survival, drove apoptosis, and induced tumor inflammation. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study primary OS tumors derived from Osx-Cre driven conditional knockout of Rb1 and Trp53. We showed that murine OS models recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment complexity observed in patient tumors. We further compared this model with OS models with functional disruption of Skp2: one with Skp2 knockout and the other with the Skp2-p27 interaction disrupted (resulting in p27 overexpression). We found reduction of T cell exhaustion and upregulation of interferon activation, along with evidence of replicative and endoplasmic reticulum-related stress in the Skp2 disruption models, and showed that interferon induction was correlated with improved survival in OS patients. Additionally, our scRNA-seq analysis uncovered decreased activities of metastasis-related gene signatures in the Skp2-disrupted OS, which we validated by observation of a strong reduction in lung metastasis in the Skp2 knockout mice. Finally, we report several potential mechanisms of escape from targeting Skp2 in OS, including upregulation of Myc targets, DNA copy number amplification and overexpression of alternative E3 ligase genes, and potential alternative lineage activation. These mechanistic insights into OS tumor biology and Skp2 function suggest novel targets for new, synergistic therapies, while the data and our comprehensive analysis may serve as a public resource for further big data-driven OS research.	cancer_biology biology dna cell metastasis transcriptomics tumors osteosarcoma tumor genomic		2024-06-06								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/06/2024.06.04.597347.source.xml		Deyou Zheng	14	0
Up-regulated transcriptional regulators in mutant RAS gene signatures: a time-resolved multi-omics study in generic epithelial cell models	The expression of mutated RAS genes drives extensive transcriptome alterations. Perturbation experiments have shown that the transcriptional responses to downstream effector pathways are partially unique and non-overlapping, suggesting a modular organization of the RAS-driven expression program. However, the relationship between individual deregulated transcription factors and the entire cancer cell-specific genetic program is poorly understood. To identify potential regulators of the RAS/MAPK-dependent fraction of the genetic program, we monitored transcriptome and proteome changes following conditional, time-resolved expression of mutant HRASG12V in human epithelial cells during neoplastic conversion. High mobility group AT hook2 (HMGA2), an architectural chromatin modulating protein and oncofetal tumour marker, was recovered as the earliest upregulated transcription factor. Knock-down of HMGA2 reverted anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition not only in HRAS-transformed cells but also in an independent, KRASG12V-driven rat epithelial model. Moreover, HMGA2 silencing reverted the deregulated expression of 60% of RAS-responsive target genes. These features qualify HMGA2 as a master regulator of mutant RAS-driven expression patterns. The delayed deregulation of FOSL1, ZEB1 and other transcription factors with known oncogenic activity suggests that HMGA2 acts in concert with a network of regulatory factors to trigger full neoplastic conversion. Although transcription factors are considered difficult to drug, the central role of HMGA2 in the transcription factor network as well as its relevance for cancer prognosis has motivated attempts to block its function using small molecular weight compounds. The further development of direct HMGA2 antagonists may prove useful in cancer cells that have developed resistance to signalling chain inhibition.	cancer_biology genes genetic epithelial transcriptome cancer tumour cell gene mutant transcriptional		2024-06-06								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/06/2024.06.04.597297.source.xml		Reinhold Schäfer	15	0
Mechanical compressive forces increase PI3K output signaling in breast and pancreatic cancer cells	ContextMechanical stresses, including compression, arise during cancer progression. In solid cancer, especially breast and pancreatic cancers, the rapid tumor growth and the environment remodeling explain their high intensity of compressive forces. However, the sensitivity of compressed cells to targeted therapies remains poorly known.  ResultsIn breast and pancreatic cancer cells, pharmacological PI3K inactivation decreased cell number and induced apoptosis. These effects were accentuated when we applied 2D compression forces in mechanically responsive cells. Compression selectively induced overexpression of PI3K isoforms and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Further, transcriptional effects of PI3K inhibition and compression converged to control the expression of an autophagy regulator, GABARAP, which level was inversely associated with PI3K inhibitor sensitivity under compression. Compression alone blocked autophagy flux in all tested cells, while inactivation of basal PI3K activity restored autophagy flux only in mechanically non-responsive compressed cells.  ConclusionThis study provides direct evidence for the role of PI3K/AKT pathway in compression-induced mechanotransduction. PI3K inhibition promotes apoptosis or autophagy, explaining PI3K importance to control cancer cell survival under compression.	cancer_biology breast pancreatic pi3k remodeling cancers cells cancer tumor		2024-05-30								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/30/2021.10.18.464825.source.xml		Julie  Guillermet-Guibert	16	0

KRAS-mediated upregulation of CIP2A promotes suppression of PP2A-B56α to initiate pancreatic cancer development	Oncogenic mutations in KRAS are present in approximately 95% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and are considered the initiating event of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) precursor lesions. While it is well established that KRAS mutations drive the activation of oncogenic kinase cascades during pancreatic oncogenesis, the effects of oncogenic KRAS signaling on regulation of phosphatases during this process is not fully appreciated. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated in suppressing KRAS-driven cellular transformation. However, low PP2A activity is observed in PDAC cells compared to non-transformed cells, suggesting that suppression of PP2A activity is an important step in the overall development of PDAC. In the current study, we demonstrate that KRASG12D induces the expression of both an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity, Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), and the PP2A substrate, c-MYC. Consistent with these findings, KRASG12D sequestered the specific PP2A subunit responsible for c-MYC degradation, B56, away from the active PP2A holoenzyme in a CIP2A-dependent manner. During PDAC initiation in vivo, knockout of B56 promoted KRASG12D tumorigenesis by accelerating acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and the formation of PanIN lesions. The process of ADM was attenuated ex vivo in response to pharmacological re-activation of PP2A utilizing direct small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs). Together, our results suggest that suppression of PP2A-B56 through KRAS signaling can promote the MYC-driven initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis.	cancer_biology tumorigenesis cip2a pancreatic cancerous adenocarcinoma b56α pp2a metaplasia cancer		2024-05-23								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2023.07.01.547283.source.xml		Brittany Allen-Petersen	20	0
The Hidden Potential of PDE4 Inhibitor Rolipram: A Multifaceted Examination of its Inhibition of MMP2/9 Reveals Therapeutic Implications	A PDE4 inhibitor, Rolipram, was previously found to down-regulate (in a manner dependent on cAMP-PKA) MMP2 and MMP9 levels, important markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer cell lines. However, zymographic studies revealed that rolipram could also alter the enzymatic activities of these MMPs, even in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89. This calls for more detailed investigations of the inhibitory mechanism of rolipram on MMP2 and MMP9. The prediction of ligand-based targets through online reverse screening indicated that proteases are likely targets of rolipram. Computational molecular docking also demonstrated significant binding affinities of rolipram for both MMP2 and MMP9 proteins. Concurrently, a well-known inhibitor of MMPs, SB3CT, was utilized as a positive control for this study. The best models of the docked complexes were used as initial conditions for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore their dynamic behavior and stability. In particular, both the MMP2-rolipram and MMP9-rolipram complexes were found to be stable and compact for the duration of the simulation (300 ns). Several stable hydrogen bonds were also detected between the proteins and rolipram. In vitro experiments using primary cells from patients with breast cancer also showed that rolipram could alter the enzymatic activities of MMP2 and MMP9, independent of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. These observations indicate the ability of rolipram to control breast cancer by regressing the functions of MMP2 and MMP9, thus having  off-targets other than PDE4 to have direct control over proteins that are involved in the advancement of metastasis.	cancer_biology examination epithelial therapeutic rolipram metastasis inhibitor ligand cancer pde4		2024-05-23								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.16.594542.source.xml		Arunima Biswas	21	0
Biological activity of a stable 6-aryl-2-benzoyl-pyridine colchicine-binding site inhibitor, 60c, in metastatic, triple-negative breast cancer	BackgroundImproving survival for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease and overcoming chemoresistance remain significant clinical challenges in treating breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by a lack of therapeutically targetable receptors (ER/PR/HER2). TNBC therapy includes a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies, including microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) like paclitaxel (taxane class) or eribulin (vinca class); however, there are currently no FDA-approved MTAs that bind to the colchicine-binding site. Approximately 70% of patients who initially respond to paclitaxel will develop taxane resistance (TxR). We previously reported that an orally bioavailable colchicine-binding site inhibitor (CBSI), VERU-111, inhibits TNBC tumor growth and treats pre-established metastatic disease. To further improve the potency and metabolic stability of VERU-111, we created next-generation derivatives of its scaffold, including 60c.  Results60c shows improved in vitro potency compared to VERU-111 for taxane-sensitive and TxR TNBC models, and suppress TxR primary tumor growth without gross toxicity. 60c also suppressed the expansion of axillary lymph node metastases existing prior to treatment. Comparative analysis of excised organs for metastasis between 60c and VERU-111 suggested that 60c has unique anti-metastatic tropism. 60c completely suppressed metastases to the spleen and was more potent to reduce metastatic burden in the leg bones and kidney.

KDM2B is required for ribosome biogenesis and its depletion unequally affects mRNA translation	KDM2B is a JmjC domain lysine demethylase, which promotes cell immortalization, stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Here we employed a multi-omics strategy to address its role in ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation. These processes are required to sustain cell proliferation, an important cancer hallmark. Contrary to earlier observations, KDM2B promotes ribosome biogenesis by stimulating the transcription of genes encoding ribosome biogenesis factors and ribosomal proteins, particularly those involved in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunits. Knockdown of KDM2B impaired the assembly of the small and large subunit processomes, as evidenced by specific defects in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. The final outcome was a decrease in the rate of ribosome assembly and in the abundance of ribosomes, and inhibition of mRNA translation. The inhibition of translation was distributed unequally among mRNAs with different features, suggesting that mRNA-embedded properties influence how mRNAs interpret ribosome abundance. This study identified a novel mechanism contributing to the regulation of translation and provided evidence for a rich biology elicited by a pathway that depends on KDM2B, and perhaps other regulators of translation.	cancer_biology biology tumorigenesis ribosomal biogenesis depletion mrna ribosome cancer kdm2b		2024-05-23								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595403.source.xml		Vollter Anastas	23	0
Spatial Profiling of Metals through Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging	The spatial-omic analysis of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites, and proteins is advancing the study of biological systems and processes in a physio-pathological context. Here, we describe an innovative matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) method to detect metals within biological tissues using instrumentation that is widely available in research and clinical laboratories. We characterize the spatial distribution of metals in diverse settings including mouse embryogenesis, genetic disorders leading to abnormal metal accumulation, and preclinical testing for improved platinum-based chemotherapy delivery through focused ultrasound across the blood-brain barrier. Spatial metal profiling will advance research studies and the clinical analysis of metal-related diseases, enabling more precise use of metal-based therapies and advances in diverse scientific fields beyond biomedicine.

Super-Enhancer Driven ZFP36L1 Promotes PD-L1 Expression in Infiltrative Gastric Cancer	Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite the widespread recognition of tumor immunotherapy in treating unresectable GC, challenges, including ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance, persist. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1, particularly in the context of super-enhancers (SEs) and zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 1 (ZFP36L1) RNA-binding protein, is crucial.  MethodsIn this study, we performed H3K27ac CUT&Tag sequencing, investigated the heterogeneity of SEs between two GC subtypes with differential growth patterns, and revealed the immune escape signatures driven by ZFP36L1-SE in infiltrative GC through SEs inhibitors treatment. The regulation of ZFP36L1 to PD-L1 was evaluated by quantitative PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we explored its regulatory mechanisms using a combination of molecular biology techniques, including luciferase reporter assay, GST/RNA pull-down, ChIP/RIP experiments, and in vivo functional assays.  ResultsWe demonstrated that ZFP36L1, driven by an SE, enhances IFN-{gamma}-induced PD-L1 expression, with SPI1 identified as the specific transcription factor binding to ZFP36L1-SE. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds to the adenylate uridylate-rich element in the 3'UTR of HDAC3 mRNA, exacerbating its mRNA decay, and thereby facilitating PD-L1 abnormal transcriptional activation.  ConclusionsCollectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the SPI1- ZFP36L1-HDAC3-PD-L1 signaling axis in orchestrating immune escape mechanisms in GC, thereby offering valuable insights into the potential targets for immune checkpoint therapy in GC management.	cancer_biology cancer infiltrative zfp36l1 exacerbating enhancer immunohistochemistry immunotherapy gastric tumor		2024-05-23								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595316.source.xml		Jianchun Cai	25	0
Development of fluoro-7-aminocarboxycoumarin-based mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitors as anticancer agents	Reprogrammed metabolism of cancer cells offers a unique target for pharmacological intervention. In the current study, a series of novel and potentially metabolically stable fluoro-substituted aminocarboxycoumarin derivatives are evaluated for their mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibition properties. Our studies indicate that the aminocarboxycoumarin template elicits potent MPC inhibitory characteristics, and specifically, structure activity relationship studies show that the N-methyl-N-benzyl structural template provides the optimal inhibitory capacity. Further respiratory experiments demonstrate that candidate compounds specifically inhibit pyruvate driven respiration without substantially affecting other metabolic fuels consistent with MPC inhibition. Further, computational homology and inhibitor docking studies illustrate that aminocarboxycoumarin binding characteristics are indicative of reversible covalent bonding with amino acids in the pyruvate binding domain. Epifluorescent microscopy experiments illustrated that FACC2 accumulates in the mitochondria to a similar extent as parent 7ACC2. Additionally, lead candidate aminocarboxycoumarin derivative D7 elicits cancer cell proliferation inhibition specifically in monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expressing 4T1, consistent with its ability to accumulate intracellular lactate. In vivo tumor growth studies illustrate that D7 significantly reduces the tumor burden in two isogeneic murine cell lines 4T1 and 67nr. These studies provide novel MPC inhibitors with potential for anticancer applications.	cancer_biology mitochondria pyruvate aminocarboxycoumarin anticancer mitochondrial inhibitors pharmacological cancer tumor		2024-05-23								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595353.source.xml		Venkatram R Mereddy	26	0
Green Jackfruit Flour Prevents Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis and Progression to Hepatocellular Carcinoma via the AMPK and MAPK Signaling Pathways	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), encompassing metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver (MAFL) and steatohepatitis (MASH), which further progresses to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a serious public health concern. Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.	metabolic fibrosis cancer_biology flour obesity carcinoma green liver steatohepatitis		2024-05-23								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.23.595466.source.xml		Divya P.

Therapeutic potential of SOX9 dysruption in Combined Hepatocellular Carcinoma-Cholangiocarcinoma	Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) represents a challenging subtype of primary liver cancer with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Recently, we and others have highlighted the context-dependent roles of the biliary-specific transcription factor SOX9 in the pathogenesis of liver cancers using various Cre applications in Sox9(flox/flox) strains, to achieve elimination for exon 2 and 3 of the Sox9 gene locus as a preventive manner. Here, we reveal the contrasting responses of developmental Sox9 elimination using Alb-Cre;Sox9(flox/flox) (Sox9 LKO) versus CRISPR/Cas9-based tumor specific acute Sox9 CKO in SB-HDTVI-based Akt-YAP1 and Akt-NRAS cHCC-CCA formation. Sox9 LKO specifically abrogates the Akt-YAP1 CCA region while robustly stimulating the proliferation of remaining poorly differentiated HCC pertaining liver progenitor cell characteristics, whereas Sox9 CKO potently prevents Akt-YAP1 and Akt-NRAS cHCC-CCA development irrespective of fate of tumor cells compared to respective controls. Additionally, we find that Akt-NRAS, but not Akt-YAP1, tumor formation is partially dependent on the Sox9-Dnmt1 cascade. Pathologically, SOX9 is indispensable for Akt-YAP1-mediated HC-to-BEC/CCA reprogramming but required for the maintenance of CCA nodules. Lastly, therapeutic elimination of Sox9 using the OPN-CreERT2 strain combined with an inducible CRISPR/Cas9-based Sox9 iKO significantly reduces Akt-YAP1 cHCC-CCA tumor burden, similar to Sox9 CKO. Thus, we contrast the outcomes of acute Sox9 deletion with developmental Sox9 knockout models, emphasizing the importance of considering adaptation mechanisms in therapeutic strategies. This necessitates the careful consideration of genetic liver cancer studies using developmental Cre and somatic mutant lines, particularly for genes involved in hepatic commitment during development. Our findings suggest that SOX9 elimination may hold promise as a therapeutic approach for cHCC-CCA and underscore the need for further investigation to translate these preclinical insights into clinical applications.	cancer_biology sox9 therapeutic hepatocellular carcinoma cancers cholangiocarcinoma cancer tumor		2024-05-23								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595319.source.xml		Sungjin Ko	28	0
Ellagic acid: a potential inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 and protein arginine methyltransferase-5	Dysregulation of epigenetic processes, characterized by aberrant DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications, is a hallmark of cancer, driving its initiation, progression, and metastasis by silencing tumor suppressor genes or activating oncogenes. Perturbations in histone modifications such as H3K27me3 by EZH2 and H4R3me2s by PRMT5 play significant roles in these epigenetic alterations, disrupting normal gene expression and facilitating oncogene activation while suppressing tumor suppressor genes. Consequently, inhibitors targeting enzymes involved in DNA methylation, histone modification, or chromatin remodeling, such as PRMTs and PRC complexes, are promising anti-cancer agents, with several undergoing pre-clinical and clinical trials. Our screening of a phytochemical library revealed ellagic acid as an effective inhibitor of both EZH2 and PRMT5. Ellagic acid interacts strongly with the EZH2 and PRMT5:MEP50 complex, binding to their active sites through {pi}-cation interactions and hydrogen bonds. Surface Plasmon Resonance study confirmed potent binding affinities of ellagic acid, with KD values of 3.28E-06 and 6.54E-05 for EZH2 and PRMT5:MEP50 respectively. In-vitro assays validated inhibitory effects on EZH2 and PRMT5:MEP50 by reducing the levels of their catalytic products H3K27me3 and H4R3me2s respectively and induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Further In-vivo studies using mouse xenografts further demonstrated significant tumor size reductions upon oral administration of ellagic acid, with decreased expression of the proliferative marker ki67 and histone repressive marks. Taken together we showed that inhibition of EZH2 and PRMT5:MEP50 by ellagic acid could be used to develop breast cancer therapeutic drug.	cancer_biology arginine protein apoptosis methyltransferase acid remodeling metastasis inhibitor cancer tumor		2024-05-23								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595443.source.xml		Santosh R Kanade	29	0
Phosphodiesterase 1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and reinforces the progression of non-small cell lung cancer	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis and drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance and metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of PDE1A in NSCLC. The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC- MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A- coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A- containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated STAT3 pathway. Moreover, PDE1A suppression sensitized anti-NSCLC activity of cisplatin via regulating NRF2 and MET. This work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides therapeutic strategies for treating NSCLC patients with metastasis or cisplatin- resistance.	cancer_biology genes rna angiogenesis lung cell 1a phosphodiesterase metastasis cancer		2024-05-23								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.21.595220.source.xml		Chong Zhang	30	0
Targeting PRMT3 Impairs Methylation and Oligomerization of HSP60 to Boost Anti-Tumor Immunity by Activating cGAS/STING Signaling	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal cancer for which current available treatment options have limited efficacy. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HCC, yet resistance to immunotherapy is a major challenge. Here, we uncover protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) as a novel driver of immunotherapy resistance in HCC. We show that PRMT3 expression is induced by activated T cells in response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) via an interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma})-STAT1 signaling pathway, and that high PRMT3 expression inversely correlates with tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and predicts poor response to ICB in HCC patients. We demonstrate that genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of PRMT3 induce a profound influx of T cells into tumors and activate anti-tumor immunity to suppress HCC progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PRMT3 methylates HSP60, a mitochondrial chaperone protein, at R446, and that this novel post-translational modification is required for HSP60 oligomerization and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. We reveal that targeting PRMT3-dependent HSP60-R446 methylation boosts anti-tumor immunity by disrupting mitochondrial function, increasing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage, and activating the cGAS/STING pathway, a key innate immune sensor of cytosolic DNA. Importantly, we provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that targeting PRMT3 enhances anti-PD1 efficacy and anti-tumor immunity in HCC mouse models. Our study identifies PRMT3 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC.	boost cancer_biology activating oligomerization carcinoma immunotherapy tumors methylation cancer tumor		2024-05-23								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.23.595475.source.xml		Yunfei Yuan	31	0
Loss of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) suppresses pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis through regulating E-cadherin	"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a poor prognosis with early and frequent metastasis. While p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) has been implicated in cell migration, and invasion, the molecular mechanisms in PDAC remain unknown. In this study, we found that PAK4 overexpression was correlated with poor survival in PDAC patients through analysis of TCGA data. PAK4-amplified PDAC cells showed enhanced mobility in contrast with wild-type. PAK4 knockdown in PAK4 amplified cells inhibited cell migration, invasion, and displacement by increased and stabilized E-cadherin, which was attributed to decreased activity of Cdc42. PAK4 knock-in in PAK4 wild-type models enhanced cell migration, invasion, and displacement by reduced E-cadherin through elevated Cdc42 activity. PAK4 bounded to E-cadherin, Cdc42, and p120ctn in immunoprecipitation. In confocal imaging, the colocalization of PAK4, E-cadherin, p120ctn, and Cdc42 was also identified. In an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, PAK4 knockdown decreased primary tumor size and occurrence of malignant ascites by activation of E-cadherin. Notably, in patients tissue specimens, inverse correlation on expression of PAK4 and E-cadherin were also shown. In conclusion, our study highlights that PAK4 promotes invasive and metastatic behavior by regulating E-cadherin in PDAC. PAK4 could be a potential therapeutic target for PDAC patients.

Mathematical Modeling Unveils Optimization Strategies for Targeted Radionuclide Therapy of Blood Cancers	Targeted radionuclide therapy is based on injections of cancer-specific molecules conjugated with radioactive nuclides. Despite the specificity of this treatment, it is not devoid of side-effects limiting its use and is especially harmful for rapidly proliferating organs well perfused by blood, like bone marrow. Optimization of radioconjugates administration accounting for toxicity constraints can increase treatment efficacy. Based on our experiments on disseminated multiple myeloma mouse model treated by 225Ac-DOTA-daratumumab, we developed a mathematical model which investigation highlighted the following principles for optimization of targeted radionuclide therapy. 1) Nuclide to antibody ratio importance. The density of radioconjugates on cancer cells determines the density of radiation energy deposited in them. Low labeling ratio as well as accumulation of unlabeled antibodies and antibodies attached to decay products in the bloodstream can mitigate cancer radiation damage due to excessive occupation of specific receptors by antibodies devoid of radioactive nuclides. 2) Cancer binding capacity-based dosing. The rate of binding of drug to cancer cells depends on the total number of their specific receptors, which therefore can be estimated from the pharmacokinetic curve of diagnostic radioconjugates. Injection of doses significantly exceeding cancer binding capacity should be avoided since radioconjugates remaining in the bloodstream have negligible efficacy to toxicity ratio. 3) Particle range-guided multi-dosing. The use of short-range particle emitters and high-affinity antibodies allows for robust treatment optimization via initial saturation of cancer binding capacity, enabling redistribution of further injected radioconjugates and deposited dose towards still viable cells that continue expressing specific receptors.  SignificanceMathematical modeling yields general principles for optimization of targeted radionuclide therapy in mouse models of multiple myeloma that can be extrapolated on another cancer models and on clinical setting.	cancer_biology myeloma radiation pharmacokinetic blood mathematical cancers therapy cancer optimization		2024-05-23								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/23/2024.05.22.595377.source.xml		Maxim Kuznetsov	33	0
Transposable Elements Shape Stemness in Normal and Leukemic Hematopoiesis	Despite most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients achieving complete remission after induction chemotherapy, two-thirds will relapse with fatal disease within five years. AML is organized as a cellular hierarchy sustained by leukemia stem cells (LSC) at the apex, with LSC properties directly linked to tumor progression, therapy failure, and disease relapse 1-5. Despite the central role of LSC in poor patient outcomes, little is known about the genetic determinants driving their stemness properties. As LSCs share many functional and molecular properties with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 6, we investigated accessible chromatin unique across normal hematopoietic and cancer cell states and identified transposable elements (TEs) as genetic determinants of both primitive populations in comparison with their downstream mature progeny. A clinically-relevant TE chromatin accessibility-based LSCTE121 signature was developed that enabled patient classification based on survival outcomes. Through functional assays, primitive cell specific-TE subfamilies were found to serve as docking sites for stem cell-associated regulators of genome topology or lineage-specific transcription factors, including LYL1 in LSCs. Finally, using chromatin editing tools, we establish that chromatin accessibility at LTR12C elements in LSCs are necessary to maintain stemness properties. Our work identifies TEs as genetic drivers of primitive versus mature cell states, where distinct TE subfamilies account for stemness properties in normal versus leukemic hematopoietic stem cells.	cancer_biology stemness shape transposable leukemic leukemia myeloid hematopoiesis chemotherapy cancer tumor		2024-05-16								cc_by_nc		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/16/2021.02.16.431334.source.xml		Mathieu  Lupien	34	0
Enhancer plasticity in endometrial tumorigenesis demarcates non-coding somatic mutations and 3D-genome alterations boosting the oncogenic driver ESR1	The incidence and mortality of Endometrial Cancer (EC) is on the rise. 85% of ECs depend on Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER) for proliferation, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation in these tumors.  We generated epigenomics, transcriptomics and Hi-C datastreams in healthy and tumor endometrial tissues, identifying robust ER reprogramming and profound alterations in 3D genome organization that lead to a gain of tumor-specific enhancer activity during EC development. Integration with endometrial cancer risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as WGS data from primary tumors and metastatic samples revealed a striking enrichment of risk variants and non-coding somatic mutations at tumor-enriched ER sites. Through machine learning-based predictions and interaction proteomics analyses, we identified an enhancer mutation which alters 3D genome conformation, impairing recruitment of the transcriptional repressor EHMT2/G9a/KMT1C, thereby alleviating transcriptional repression of ESR1 in EC.  In summary, we identified a complex genomic-epigenomic interplay in EC development and progression, altering 3D genome organization to enhance expression of the critical driver ER.	cancer_biology endometrial tumorigenesis mutations tumor transcriptomics genome tumors cancer coding		2024-05-16								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/16/2023.07.25.550368.source.xml		Wilbert Zwart	35	0
CDC42 Inhibitors Alter Patterns of Vessel Arborization in Skin and Tumors in vivo	Tumors that arise in the epidermis must develop a vascular supply to grow beyond a millimeter in depth. This process requires CDC42 GTPases such as CDC42, RhoJ and RhoQ. Despite this dependence on angiogenesis for growth, melanoma tumors are minimally responsive to current anti-angiogenesis agents, highlighting the need for more effective drugs in this class. Here we integrate antibody infusion, optical tissue clearing, multiphoton imaging, and three-dimensional semi-automated tracing to develop a quantitative approach to measure changes in vascular architecture in skin and skin tumors. This new approach uncovered differences in vessel arborization in the skin of RhoJ KO mice as compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, novel small molecules that inhibit CDC42 GTPases inhibited both tumor growth and vessel branching within tumors to a similar degree as Braf inhibitors, which are commonly used to treat melanoma. In contrast to Braf inhibitors, however, which only affected tumor vasculature, CDC42 inhibitors affected vascularization in both tumor and normal skin without apparent toxicity to endothelial or stromal cells. These novel CDC42 inhibitors similarly blocked vessel branching in human cell-based micro-physiological models of normal and tumor vessels. RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression of multiple angiogenesis-related genes in drug-treated skin. Taken together, these studies identify a new class of pharmacologic agents that inhibit vessel branching in both normal skin and tumors with potential utility for treating skin cancer and skin diseases characterized by pathologic angiogenesis.	cancer_biology arborization endothelial angiogenesis patterns cdc42 tumors inhibitors cancer tumor		2024-05-16								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/16/2024.04.09.588609.source.xml		Anand K Ganesan	36	0
Constitutive Photomorphogenesis Protein 1 homolog (COP1) sustains nuclear factor-4 alpha function in human hepatocyte models	Constitutive Photomorphogenesis Protein 1 homolog (COP1) is a conserved E3 ligase with key roles in several biological systems. Prior work in hepatocyte derived tumors categorized COP1 as an oncogene but its role in untransformed hepatocytes remains largely unexplored. Here we have investigated the role of COP1 in primary human hepatocytes as well as in two transformed hepatocyte models, HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Contrary to a previous report, COP1 suppression via siRNA had no noticeable impact on HepG2 and HuH-7 proliferation and was associated with contrasting rather than congruent transcriptome changes. Clustering analyses identified patterns indicative of perturbed metabolism in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells whereas patterns pointed to cell proliferation impacts in HuH-7 cells. In HepG2 and primary hepatocytes, COP1 suppression reduced the expression important hepatic regulators and markers, which could be restored by the introduction of a siRNA resistant COP1 transgene. COP1 downregulation reduced hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4A) abundance and function, as assessed by lower abundance of key HNF4A targets and reduced APOB secretion. HNF4A restoration partially rescued COP1 silencing in HepG2 cells. This study identifies COP1 as a key regulator of hepatocyte function, in part via HNF4A. COP1 was required to maintain HNF4A abundance and function in primary hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells, but not in HuH-7 cells. Lastly, by demonstrating contrasting roles of COP1 in HuH-7 and HepG2 cells, our findings also challenge previous work linking COP1 to hepatic tumorigenesis.	cancer_biology photomorphogenesis tumorigenesis homolog protein hepatocytes hnf4a cop1 tumors hepatocyte hepatic		2024-05-09								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/09/2024.01.11.575239.source.xml		Sébastien Soubeyrand	37	0
RGS10 deficiency facilitates distant metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer	AbstractDistant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulate metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing RGS10 in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and miR-539-5p. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.	mesenchymal cancer_biology epithelial breast cancers metastasis death invasive cancer tumor		2024-05-09								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/09/2024.03.04.583283.source.xml		Xi Gu	38	0
In vitro efficacy and in vivo toxicity and retention of targeted nanoformulated carboplatin in a sustained release carrier for treatment of osteosarcoma	Objectiveevaluate 1) if targeting of platinum magnetic nanoclusters will promote uptake in osteosarcoma cells in vitro, 2) targeting will improve uptake and delivery in murine OSA in vivo compared to free carboplatin, 3) incorporation into a sustained release carrier (SRC) will prolong local retention in vivo.  MethodsComplex stability and peptide loading was assessed. Drug release was tested at pH 7.4 and 5.5 and cellular uptake and cytotoxity determined for canine, human and mouse osteosarcoma. Subcutaneous murine osteosarcoma was induced and optimal dose and time until tumor growth were established. Tumor bearing mice were equally distributed between 8 treatment (0.5mg carboplatin/mouse) and 1 control group and sacrificed at 8 predetermined time points between 1 hour and 8 days. Blood, tumor site and organs were harvested for tissue ferron and platinum content analysis (ICP-MS).  ResultsCarboplatin was preferentially released at pH5.5. Targeting increased cellular uptake for carboplatin 15.2-fold, and decreased IC50 at 24h and 48h. At 2 weeks, a SC injection of 1-1.56 live cells/mouse reliably resulted in a palpable tumor. Plasma platinum peaked prior to 6 hours while plasma ferron peaked at 24-48 hours. Intratumoral delivery did not lead to a sustained local presence while local delivery in a SRC after surgery did.  ConclusionsTargeting of MNC-carboplatin is possible with an increased osteosarcoma cell uptake in vitro. In vivo metastatic uptake could not be assessed due to lack of metastases, but local delivery in a SRC yielded high local, and low systemic platinum concentrations in mice.	cancer_biology platinum surgery nanoformulated vitro nanoclusters osteosarcoma carboplatin tumor treatment		2024-05-09								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/09/2024.05.02.590788.source.xml		Marije Risselada	39	0
Targeting SCD triggers lipotoxicity of cancer cells and enhances anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer brain metastasis mouse models	Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are a significant cause of mortality and are incurable. Thus, identifying BCBM targets that reduce morbidity and mortality is critical. BCBM upregulate Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a potential metabolic vulnerability of BCBM. In this study, we tested the effect of a brain-penetrant clinical-stage inhibitor of SCD (SCDi), on breast cancer cells and mouse models of BCBM. Lipidomics, qPCR, and western blot were used to study the in vitro effects of SCDi. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to explore the effects of SCDi on cancer and immune cells in a BCBM mouse model. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD markedly reshaped the lipidome of breast cancer cells and resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage, loss of DNA damage repair, and cytotoxicity. Importantly, SCDi alone or combined with a PARP inhibitor prolonged the survival of BCBM-bearing mice. When tested in a syngeneic mouse model of BCBM, scRNAseq revealed that pharmacological inhibition of SCD enhanced antigen presentation by dendritic cells, was associated with a higher interferon signaling, increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and decreased the proportion of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of SCD decreased engagement of immunosuppressive pathways, including the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 and PVR/TIGIT axes. These findings suggest that SCD inhibition could be an effective strategy to intrinsically reduce tumor growth and reprogram anti-tumor immunity in the brain microenvironment to treat BCBM.	cancer_biology endoplasmic immunosuppressive lipotoxicity cells mouse pharmacological cancer tumor		2024-05-09								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/09/2024.05.06.592766.source.xml		Alessandro Sammarco	40	0
Lipid availability influences ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer cells by regulating polyunsaturated fatty acid trafficking	Ferroptosis is a form of cell death caused by lipid peroxidation that is emerging as a target for cancer therapy, highlighting the need to identify factors that govern ferroptosis susceptibility. Lipid peroxidation occurs primarily on phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here, we show that even though extracellular lipid limitation reduces cellular PUFA levels, lipid-starved cancer cells are paradoxically more sensitive to ferroptosis. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with stable isotope fatty acid labeling, we show that lipid limitation induces a fatty acid trafficking pathway in which PUFAs are liberated from triglycerides to synthesize highly unsaturated PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and adrenic acid. These PUFAs then accumulate in phospholipids, particularly ether phospholipids, to promote ferroptosis sensitivity. Therefore, PUFA levels within cancer cells do not necessarily correlate with ferroptosis susceptibility. Rather, how cancer cells respond to extracellular lipid levels by trafficking PUFAs into proper phospholipid pools dictates their sensitivity to ferroptosis.	cancer_biology lipidomics polyunsaturated lipid trafficking spectrometry ferroptosis therapy cancer		2024-05-09								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/09/2024.05.06.592780.source.xml		Evan C Lien	41	0
Unveiling Novel Double-Negative Prostate Cancer Subtypes Through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis	"Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have facilitated the discovery of previously unrecognized subtypes within prostate cancer (PCa), offering new insights into disease heterogeneity and progression. In this study, we integrated scRNAseq data from multiple studies, comprising both publicly available cohorts and data generated by our research team, and established the HuPSA (Human Prostate Single cell Atlas) and the MoPSA (Mouse Prostate Single cell Atlas) datasets. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified two novel double-negative PCa populations: KRT7 cells characterized by elevated KRT7 expression, and progenitor-like cells marked by SOX2 and FOXA2 expression, distinct from NEPCa, and displaying stem/progenitor features. Furthermore, HuPSA-based deconvolution allowed for the re-classification of human PCa specimens, validating the presence of these novel subtypes. Leveraging these findings, we developed a user-friendly web application, ""HuPSA-MoPSA"" (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/HuPSA-MoPSA/), for visualizing gene expression across all newly-established datasets. Our study provides comprehensive tools for PCa research and uncovers novel cancer subtypes that can inform clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Decoil: Reconstructing extrachromosomal DNA structural heterogeneity from long-read sequencing data	Circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a form of oncogene amplification found across cancer types and associated with poor outcome in patients. EcDNA can be structurally complex and contain rearranged DNA sequences derived from multiple chromosome locations. As the structure of ecDNA can impact oncogene regulation and may indicate mechanisms of its formation, disentangling it at high resolution from sequencing data is essential. Even though methods have been developed to identify and reconstruct ecDNA in cancer genome sequencing, it remains challenging to resolve complex ecDNA structures, in particular amplicons with shared genomic footprints. We here introduce Decoil, a computational method which combines a breakpoint-graph approach with LASSO regression to reconstruct complex ecDNA and deconvolve co-occurring ecDNA elements with overlapping genomic footprints from long-read nanopore sequencing. Decoil outperforms de-novo assembly and alignment-based methods in simulated longread sequencing data for both simple and complex ecDNAs. Applying Decoil on whole genome sequencing data uncovered different ecDNA topologies and explored ecDNA structure heterogeneity in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines, indicating that this method may improve ecDNA structural analyzes in cancer.	cancer_biology reconstructing sequencing dna data neuroblastoma extrachromosomal tumors cancer		2024-05-02								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/02/2023.11.15.567169.source.xml		Anton G.

PTBP2 promotes cell survival and autophagy in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia by stabilizing BNIP3	Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) regulates alternative splicing in neuronal, muscle, and Sertoli cells. PTBP2 and its paralog, PTBP1, which plays a role in B-cell development, was found to be expressed aberrantly in myeloid leukemia. Genetic ablation of Ptbp2 in the cells resulted in decreased cellular proliferation and repopulating ability, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered mitochondrial morphology. The sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib increased after the knockout of Ptbp2. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) and functional assays confirmed that PTBP2 binds to Bcl-2 Interacting Protein 3 (Bnip3)-3UTR and stabilizes its expression. Our study also suggests that PTBP2 promotes autophagy, as evidenced by the low levels of LC3-II expression in Ptbp2-knockout cells treated with Bafilomycin A1. This effect was restored upon overexpression of Bnip3 in the knockout cells. Notably, when KCL22-NTC cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of mice, they gave rise to malignant tumors, unlike Ptbp2-KO-KCL22 cells. This underscores the role of PTBP2 in promoting cell proliferation and tumor formation while enhancing autophagy through Bnip3, thereby supporting the role of PTBP2 as an oncogene in CML.	cancer_biology autophagy ptbp2 myeloid leukemia stabilizing tumors tumor		2024-05-02								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/02/2024.01.26.577177.source.xml		Soumen chakraborty	44	0
Aberrant cytoplasmic localization of MLH1 characterizes a sub-clonal breast cancer cell population that seeds recurrence	Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in women. Mortality is largely driven by recurrence of treatment-resistant disease after many years of apparent response, making the molecular events that cause recurrence a critical area of investigation. Loss of expression of MLH1, a tumor suppressor best studied in its role in mismatch repair, induces resistance of ER+ breast cancer cells to standard estrogen-targeting therapies. It does so by delinking cell cycle progression from estrogen regulation, a role distinct from its function in mismatch repair. MLH1 loss, as currently clinically diagnosed by detecting genomic instability or by immunohistochemistry for absence of protein, occurs in 12-15% of all cancers. Here, we demonstrate that sub-clonal, patient-derived mutations in MLH1, which neither impact protein abundance nor contribute sufficiently to genomic instability to be detected diagnostically, seed endocrine treatment resistance by enabling estrogen-independent growth in vitro, ex vivo in patient-derived organoids (p=0.005) and in vivo (p=0.0001). The mechanism underlying this endocrine treatment resistance is aberrant localization of MLH1 to the cytoplasm in vitro and in vivo (p=0.04), which precludes cell cycle arrest in response to endocrine therapy while simultaneously rendering cells acutely dependent on CDK4/6 activity. Consequently, administration of CDK4/6 inhibitors causes extreme regression in cells with cytoplasmic MLH1 compared to control cell populations with nuclear localization of MLH1 in vitro (p=0.00000009), ex vivo (p=0.01) and in vivo (p=0.01). As aberrant cytoplasmic localization occurs in an additional [~]12% of ER+ breast cancer patients, it constitutes a new, major contributor to MLH1 dysregulation. The potential applicability of cytoplasmic MLH1 as a predictor of responsiveness to existing targeted therapies in a hard-to-treat breast cancer subtype posits an update of current clinical diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies. This is particularly important in the adjuvant setting where identification of biomarkers predicting responsiveness to CDK4/6 inhibitors remains an urgent, unmet clinical need.	cancer_biology estrogen aberrant breast cytoplasmic recurrence cancers immunohistochemistry cancer tumor		2024-05-02								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/05/02/2024.02.27.582389.source.xml		Svasti Haricharan	45	0

Magnetic particle imaging reveals that iron-labeled extracellular vesicles accumulate in brains of mice with metastases	"The incidence of breast cancer remains high worldwide and is associated with a significant risk of metastasis to the brain that can be fatal; this is due, in part, to the inability of therapeutics to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been found to cross the BBB and further, have been used to deliver drugs to tumors. EVs from different cell types appear to have different patterns of accumulation and retention as well as efficiency of bioactive cargo delivery to recipient cells in the body. Engineering EVs as delivery tools to treat brain metastases, therefore, will require an understanding of the timing of EV accumulation, and their localization relative to metastatic sites. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a sensitive and quantitative imaging method that directly detects superparamagnetic iron. Here, we demonstrate MPI as a novel tool to characterize EV biodistribution in metastatic disease after labeling EVs with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Iron-labeled EVs (FeEVs) were collected from iron-labeled parental primary 4T1 tumor cells and brain-seeking 4T1BR5 cells, followed by injection into mice with orthotopic tumors or brain metastases. MPI quantification revealed that FeEVs were retained for longer in orthotopic mammary carcinomas compared to SPIOs. MPI signal due to iron could only be detected in brains of mice bearing brain metastases after injection of FeEVs, but not SPIOs, or FeEVs when mice did not have brain metastases. These findings indicate the potential use of EVs as a therapeutic delivery tool in primary and metastatic tumors.

Transcriptional remodeling of the Stromal and Endothelial Microenvironment in MGUS to Multiple Myeloma Progression	"The role of the bone marrow microenvironment (BME) in the transition from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) into clinically active multiple myeloma (MM) is not completely determined. To address this issue, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of non-hematopoietic BME cells as well as plasma cells (PC) from two genetically engineered mouse models of MM termed BIc{gamma}1and MIc{gamma}1that recapitulate the progression of MGUS into MM. Our results identify distinct transcriptional dynamics between endothelial cells (EC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). While EC acquire a stress state during MGUS, a proliferating and angiogenic profile characterizes MM. On the other hand, MSC compromised their differentiation potential, exhibiting a more inflammatory profile that initiates from the MGUS stage. Interestingly, we identified an interferon (IFN)-related myeloma signature in malignant EC of the BIc{gamma}1model, which is also expressed in MSC but not observed in the more aggressive MIc{gamma}1model and can be identified in MSC from a subgroup of MM patients. The analysis of the EC and MSC interactions with malignant PC revealed stage-specific interactions that contribute to angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and MM extravasation. Finally, the translational relevance of our results in humans was confirmed on MSC from newly diagnosed patients with monoclonal gammopathies at different stages of the disease. In summary, these results show a remodeling of the non-hematopoietic BME in MM progression, providing potential targets at the tumor-niche interface that may hold clinical significance and complement existing immunotherapies.

RGS10 deficiency facilitates distant metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer	AbstractDistant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulate metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing RGS10 in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and miR-539-5p. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.	mesenchymal cancer_biology epithelial breast cancers metastasis death invasive cancer tumor		2024-04-25								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/25/2024.03.04.583283.source.xml		Xi Gu	49	0
Disruption of Circadian Clock Induces Abnormal Mammary Morphology and Aggressive Basal Tumorigenesis by Enhancing LILRB4 Signaling	Epidemiological studies have shown that circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is associated with the risk of breast cancer. However, the role of CRD in mammary gland morphology and aggressive basal mammary tumorigenesis and the molecular mechanisms underlying CRD and cancer risk remain unknown. To investigate the effect of CRD on aggressive tumorigenesis, a genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates the human basal type of breast cancer was used for this study. The effect of CRD on mammary gland morphology was investigated using wild-type mice model. The impact of CRD on the tumor microenvironment was investigated using the tumors from LD12:12 and CRD mice via scRNA seq. ScRNA seq was substantiated by multiplexing immunostaining, flow cytometry, and realtime PCR. The effect of LILRB4 immunotherapy on CRD-induced tumorigenesis was also investigated. Here we identified the impact of CRD on basal tumorigenesis and mammary gland morphology and identified the role of LILRB4 on CRD-induced lung metastasis. We found that chronic CRD disrupted mouse mammary gland morphology and increased tumor burden, and lung metastasis and induced an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by enhancing LILRB4a expression. Moreover, CRD increased the M2-macrophage and regulatory T-cell populations but decreased the M1-macrophage populations. Furthermore, targeted immunotherapy against LILRB4 reduced CRD-induced immunosuppressive microenvironment and lung metastasis. These findings identify and implicate LILRB4a as a link between CRD and aggressive mammary tumorigenesis. This study also establishes the potential role of the targeted LILRB4a immunotherapy as an inhibitor of CRD-induced lung metastasis.	cancer_biology mammary tumorigenesis disruption abnormal aggressive tumors immunostaining cancer tumor		2024-04-25								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/25/2024.03.19.585534.source.xml		Tapasree Roy Sarkar	50	0
Peristromal niches protect lung cancers from targeted therapies through a combined effect of multiple molecular mediators	Targeted therapies directed against oncogenic signaling addictions, such as inhibitors of ALK in ALK+ NSCLC often induce strong and durable clinical responses. However, they are not curative in metastatic cancers, as some tumor cells persist through therapy, eventually developing resistance. Therapy sensitivity can reflect not only cell-intrinsic mechanisms but also inputs from stromal microenvironment. Yet, the contribution of tumor stroma to therapeutic responses in vivo remains poorly defined. To address this gap of knowledge, we assessed the contribution of stroma-mediated resistance to therapeutic responses to the frontline ALK inhibitor alectinib in xenograft models of ALK+ NSCLC. We found that stroma-proximal tumor cells are partially protected against cytostatic effects of alectinib. This effect is observed not only in remission, but also during relapse, indicating the strong contribution of stroma-mediated resistance to both persistence and resistance. This therapy-protective effect of the stromal niche reflects a combined action of multiple mechanisms, including growth factors and extracellular matrix components. Consequently, despite improving alectinib responses, suppression of any individual resistance mechanism was insufficient to fully overcome the protective effect of stroma. Focusing on shared collateral sensitivity of persisters offered a superior therapeutic benefit, especially when using an antibody-drug conjugate with bystander effect to limit therapeutic escape. These findings indicate that stroma-mediated resistance might be the major contributor to both residual and progressing disease and highlight the limitation of focusing on suppressing a single resistance mechanism at a time.	cancer_biology lung molecular tumor disease therapies relapse cancers therapy peristromal		2024-04-25								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/25/2024.04.24.590626.source.xml		Andriy Marusyk	51	0
The invasion phenotypes of glioblastoma depend on plastic and reprogrammable cell states	Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain cancer in adults, is characterized by rapid local invasion along diverse routes, such as infiltration of white matter tracts and penetration of perivascular spaces. We investigate the hypothesis that GBM invasion routes correlate with the transcriptional states of individual cells and identify regulators of route-specific invasion. Utilizing patient-derived GBM xenograft models, we integrate single-cell transcriptomics and spatial proteomics, revealing that mesenchymal and oligodendrocyte progenitor-like GBM cells migrate perivascularly, while neural progenitor and astrocyte-like GBM cells invade diffusely. Computational reconstruction identifies ANXA1 as a perivascular invasion driver and lineage-restricted transcription factors RFX4 and HOPX as drivers of diffuse invasion, predictive of patient survival. Genetic ablation of these genes alters invasion phenotypes and extends survival in xenografted mice, clarifying the role of cell states in GBM invasion, and highlighting potential therapeutic targets for selective invasion route targeting in GBM patients.	cancer_biology genetic cell reprogrammable phenotypes proteomics plastic glioblastoma transcriptomics cancer		2024-04-25								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/25/2024.04.23.589925.source.xml		Sven Nelander	52	0
An imbalance between proliferation and differentiation underlies the development of microRNA-defective pineoblastoma	Mutations in the microRNA processing genes DICER1 and DROSHA drive several cancers that resemble embryonic progenitors. To understand how microRNAs regulate tumorigenesis, we ablated Drosha or Dicer1 in the developing pineal gland to emulate the pathogenesis of pineoblastoma, a brain tumor that resembles undifferentiated precursors of the pineal gland. Accordingly, these mice develop pineal tumors marked by loss of microRNAs, including the let-7/miR-98-5p family, and de-repression of microRNA target genes. Pineal tumors driven by loss of Drosha or Dicer1 mimic tumors driven by Rb1 loss, as they exhibit upregulation of S-phase genes and homeobox transcription factors that regulate pineal development. Blocking proliferation of these tumors facilitates expression of pinealocyte maturation markers, with a concomitant reduction in embryonic markers. Select embryonic markers remain elevated, however, as the microRNAs that normally repress these target genes remain absent. One such microRNA target gene is the oncofetal transcription factor Plagl2, which regulates expression of pro-growth genes, and inhibiting their signaling impairs tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate that tumors driven by loss of microRNA processing may be therapeutically targeted by inhibiting downstream drivers of proliferation.	cancer_biology microrna tumorigenesis imbalance defective cancers pineoblastoma pathogenesis tumors tumor underlies		2024-04-25								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/25/2024.04.23.590638.source.xml		Kenneth S Chen	53	0

Nonlinear progression across the occult transition establishes cancer lethality	"Cancer screening is based upon a linear model of growth and invasion. Yet, early dissemination during the lengthy pre-diagnostic phase suggests that nonlinearity in growth can also occur. Therefore, we quantitatively traced the invisible and visible phases of tumorigenesis in the mammary gland for more than two-thousand tumors. Dynamic mathematical models of the invisible phase revealed an occult checkpoint resulting in nonlinear progression of transformed field cells. We found that expansile fields have increased dwell time at the occult checkpoint resulting in a large reservoir of image detectable precursors prior to invasion. In contrast, slowly proliferating lesions disseminate early and then transition rapidly through an occult checkpoint in a process we term nascent lethality. Our data illustrate how nonlinear growth across an occult checkpoint can account for a paradoxical increase in early-stage cancer detection without a dramatic reduction in metastatic burden.

An Alternatively Spliced Gain-of-Function NT5C2 Isoform Contributes to Thiopurine Resistance in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	"Relapse-specific mutations do not account for all chemotherapy failures in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). By mining RNA-seq datasets of paired diagnostic/relapse pediatric B-ALL samples, we discovered pervasive alternative splicing (AS) patterns linked to relapse and affecting drivers of resistance to glucocorticoids, anti-folates, and thiopurines. Most splicing variations represent exon skipping, ""poison"" exon inclusion, and intron retention, phenocopying well-documented loss-of-function mutations. In contrast, relapse-associated AS of NT5C2 mRNA yields an isoform with a cryptic 24-nt in-frame exon 6a. Inclusion of the extra 8 amino acids into this enzyme results in elevated nucleosidase activity, a known consequence of gain-of-function mutations in NT5C2 and a common determinant of 6-mercaptopurine resistance. Furthermore, in B-ALL cells NT5C2ex6a and the R238W hotspot variant confers comparable levels of resistance to 6-mercaptopurine in vitro and in vivo. These results support a role for alternative splicing as a prevalent mechanism driving chemotherapy resistance in relapsed B-ALL.  Statement of significanceMutations in chemoresistance genes are found in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, in this low-mutational-burden disease, up to 30% of cases have no known relapse-specific genetic alterations. Our identification of aberrant splicing as an alternative mechanism of acquired drug resistance fills this gap and suggests new opportunities for therapeutic interventions."	cancer_biology genetic mutations leukemia spliced chemotherapy thiopurine nt5c2 lymphoblastic		2024-04-18								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/18/2023.09.14.557413.source.xml		Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko	56	0
KSR1 regulates small-cell lung carcinoma tumor initiation and therapy resistance	Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is designated a recalcitrant cancer due to its five-year relative survival rate of less than 7%.

Finding novel therapeutic options that effectively eliminate residual disease observed after initial response to therapy is essential to improving SCLC patient outcome. Here we show that Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), a molecular scaffold for the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is critical for clonogenicity and tumor initiation in vitro and in vivo in the highly aggressive, metastatic and therapy resistant NeuroD1 subtype of SCLC. Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are reported as the sanctuary population within the bulk tumor responsible for therapeutic resistance and relapse. Previous studies concluded ERK activation was inhibitory to growth and tumor development. We show that signaling through KSR1 is conserved in SCLC-N and that it regulates tumor initiation through interaction with ERK. We further show that KSR1 mediates cisplatin resistance in SCLC-N cells. While 50% of control SCLC-N cells show resistance after 6 weeks of exposure to cisplatin, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KSR1 knockout prevents resistance in >90% of SCLC-N cells. KSR1 KO also significantly enhances the ability of cisplatin to decrease SCLC-N TICs, indicating that targeting KSR1 might be selectively toxic to cells responsible for therapeutic resistance and tumor initiation. Thus, KSR1 function in SCLC-N serves as a novel model for understanding the role of KSR1-dependent signaling in normal and malignant tissues. These findings shed light on a key distinct protein responsible for regulation in SCLC-N tumors, and a potential subtype specific therapeutic target.  ImpactGenetic manipulation of the MAPK molecular scaffold, KSR1 in NeuroD1-subtype small-cell lung cancer cells reveals its contribution to cisplatin resistance in tumor initiation via ERK signaling.	cancer_biology lung cell relapse carcinoma therapy malignant tumors cancer tumor		2024-04-11								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/11/2024.02.23.581815.source.xml		Robert E Lewis	57	0
The neuroendocrine transition in prostate cancer is dynamic and dependent on ASCL1	Lineage plasticity is a recognized hallmark of cancer progression that can shape therapy outcomes. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating lineage plasticity remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a versatile in vivo platform to identify and interrogate the molecular determinants of neuroendocrine lineage transformation at different stages of prostate cancer progression. Adenocarcinomas reliably develop following orthotopic transplantation of primary mouse prostate organoids acutely engineered with human-relevant driver alterations (e.g., Rb1-/-; Trp53-/-; cMyc+ or Pten-/-; Trp53-/-; cMyc+), but only those with Rb1 deletion progress to ASCL1+ neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a highly aggressive, androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI)-resistant tumor. Importantly, we show this lineage transition requires a native in vivo microenvironment not replicated by conventional organoid culture. By integrating multiplexed immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomics and PrismSpot to identify cell type-specific spatial gene modules, we reveal that ASCL1+ cells arise from KRT8+ luminal epithelial cells that progressively acquire transcriptional heterogeneity, producing large ASCL1+;KRT8- NEPC clusters. Ascl1 loss in established NEPC results in transient tumor regression followed by recurrence; however, Ascl1 deletion prior to transplantation completely abrogates lineage plasticity, yielding adenocarcinomas with elevated AR expression and marked sensitivity to castration. The dynamic feature of this model reveals the importance of timing of therapies focused on lineage plasticity and offers a platform for identification of additional lineage plasticity drivers.	cancer_biology transition tumor ascl1 adenocarcinomas prostate transcriptomics cancer neuroendocrine immunofluorescence		2024-04-11								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/11/2024.04.09.588557.source.xml		Charles Sawyers	58	0
Establishing the foundations for a data-centric AI approach for virtual drug screening through a systematic assessment of the properties of chemical data	Researchers have adopted model-centric artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in cheminformatics by using newer, more sophisticated AI methods to take advantage of growing chemical libraries. It has been shown that complex deep learning methods outperform conventional machine learning (ML) methods in QSAR and ligand-based virtual screening1-3 but such approaches generally lack explanability. Hence, instead of developing more sophisticated AI methods (i.e., pursuing a model-centric approach), we wanted to explore the potential of a data-centric AI paradigm for virtual screening. A data-centric AI is an intelligent system that would automatically identify the right type of data to collect, clean and curate for later use by a predictive AI and this is required given the large volumes of chemical data that exist in chemical databases - PubChem alone has over 100 million unique compounds. However, a systematic assessment of the attributes and properties of suitable data is needed. We show here that it is not the result of deficiencies in current AI algorithms but rather, poor understanding and erroneous use of chemical data that ultimately leads to poor predictive performance. Using a new benchmark dataset of BRAF ligands that we developed, we show that our best performing predictive model can achieve an unprecedented accuracy of 99% with a conventional ML algorithm (SVM) using a merged molecular representation (Extended+ ECFP6 fingerprints), far surpassing past performances of virtual screening platforms using sophisticated deep learning methods. Thus, we demonstrate that it is not necessary to resort to the use of sophisticated deep learning algorithms for virtual screening because conventional ML can perform exceptionally well if given the right data and representation. We also show that the common use of decoys for training leads to high false positive rates and its use for testing will result in an over-optimistic estimation of a models predictive performance. Another common practice in virtual screening is defining compounds that are above a certain pharmacological threshold as inactives. Here, we show that the use of these so-called inactive compounds lowers a models sensitivity/recall. Considering that some target proteins have a limited number of known ligands, we wanted to also observe how the size and composition of the training data impact predictive performance. We found that an imbalance training dataset where inactives outnumber actives led to a decrease in recall but an increase in precision, regardless of the model or molecular representation used; and overall, we observed a decrease in the models accuracy. We highlight in this study some of the considerations that one needs to take into account in future development of data-centric AI for CADD.	cancer_biology researchers cheminformatics screening chemical pharmacological algorithm virtual algorithms assessment drug		2024-04-04								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/04/2024.03.28.587184.source.xml		Allen Chong	59	0
Vesicle-mediated mitochondrial clearance underlies an actionable metabolic vulnerability in triple-negative breast cancer	Selective autophagy of mitochondria is known to promote survival and progression of cancer cells in various malignancies including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we aimed to identify the essential metabolic adaptations that support mitochondrial quality control with the goal to uncover actionable metabolic vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential. Using an integrated approach of proteomics and untargeted and stable-isotope resolved metabolomics, coupled with functional experimental analyses, we define an alternative mechanism to mitophagy enabled by an onco-metabolic program of heightened extracellular sphingomyelin salvaging in TNBC that facilitates extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated intracellular clearance of mitochondrial damage. Targeting of the cancer cell sphingolipid onco-metabolic pathway via repurposing of eliglustat, a selective small molecule inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG), resulted in ceramide-induced lethal mitophagy and attenuated tumor growth and prolonged overall survival at clinically achievable doses in an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of TNBC. Our study defines a mechanism of aberrant sphingolipid metabolism that underlies an actionable metabolic vulnerability for anti-cancer treatment.	metabolic cancer_biology triple breast mitochondria sphingomyelin proteomics mitochondrial cancer tumor		2024-04-04								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/04/2024.04.04.587899.source.xml		Johannes F Fahrmann	60	0
Onco-Circuit Addiction and Onco-Nutrient mTORC1 Signaling Vulnerability in a Model of Aggressive T Cell Malignancy	How genetic lesions drive cell transformation and whether they can be circumvented without compromising function of non-transformed cells are enduring questions in oncology. Here we show that in mature T cells--in which physiologic clonal proliferation is a cardinal feature-- constitutive MYC transcription and Tsc1 loss in mice modeled aggressive human malignancy by reinforcing each others oncogenic programs. This cooperation was supported by MYC-induced large neutral amino acid transporter chaperone SLC3A2 and dietary leucine, which in synergy with Tsc1 deletion overstimulated mTORC1 to promote mitochondrial fitness and MYC protein overexpression in a positive feedback circuit. A low leucine diet was therapeutic even in late-stage disease but did not hinder T cell immunity to infectious challenge, nor impede T cell transformation driven by constitutive nutrient mTORC1 signaling via Depdc5 loss. Thus, mTORC1 signaling hypersensitivity to leucine as an onco-nutrient enables an onco-circuit, decoupling pathologic from physiologic utilization of nutrient acquisition pathways.	cancer_biology malignancy genetic aggressive oncology vulnerability addiction disease mtorc1 physiologic pathologic		2024-04-04								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/04/04/2024.04.03.587917.source.xml		Ming O Li	61	0
Small extracellular vesicles promote stiffness-mediated metastasis	"Tissue stiffness is a critical prognostic factor in breast cancer and is associated with metastatic progression. Here we show an alternative and complementary hypothesis of tumor progression whereby physiological matrix stiffness affects the quantity and protein cargo of small EVs produced by cancer cells, which in turn drive their metastasis. Primary patient breast tissue produces significantly more EVs from stiff tumor tissue than soft tumor adjacent tissue. EVs released by cancer cells on matrices that model human breast tumors (25 kPa; stiff EVs) feature increased adhesion molecule presentation (ITG2{beta}1, ITG6{beta}4, ITG6{beta}1, CD44) compared to EVs from softer normal tissue (0.5 kPa; soft EVs), which facilitates their binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen IV, and a 3-fold increase in homing ability to distant organs in mice. In a zebrafish xenograft model, stiff EVs aid cancer cell dissemination through enhanced chemotaxis. Moreover, normal, resident lung fibroblasts treated with stiff and soft EVs change their gene expression profiles to adopt a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. These findings show that EV quantity, cargo, and function depend heavily on the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment.

Tumor-infiltrating nerves functionally alter brain circuits and modulate behavior in a male mouse model of head-and-neck cancer	Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts.  The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.  Significance StatementHead and neck cancers are infiltrated by sensory nerves which connect to a pre-existing circuit that includes areas in the brain. Neurons within this circuit are altered and mediate modifications in behavior.	infiltrating cancer_biology brain cancers mouse tumors cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2023.10.18.562990.source.xml		Paola Drapkin Vermeer	63	0
Multiplexed 3D Analysis of Immune States and Niches in Human Tissue	"Tissue homeostasis and the emergence of disease are controlled by changes in the proportions of resident and recruited cells, their organization into cellular neighbourhoods, and their interactions with acellular tissue components. Highly multiplexed tissue profiling (spatial omics)1 makes it possible to study this microenvironment in situ, usually in 4-5 micron thick sections (the standard histopathology format)2. Microscopy-based tissue profiling is commonly performed at a resolution sufficient to determine cell types but not to detect subtle morphological features associated with cytoskeletal reorganisation, juxtracrine signalling, or membrane trafficking3. Here we describe a high-resolution 3D imaging approach able to characterize a wide variety of organelles and structures at sub-micron scale while simultaneously quantifying millimetre-scale spatial features. This approach combines cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) imaging4 of over 50 markers with confocal microscopy of archival human tissue thick enough (30-40 microns) to fully encompass two or more layers of intact cells. 3D imaging of entire cell volumes substantially improves the accuracy of cell phenotyping and allows cell proximity to be scored using plasma membrane apposition, not just nuclear position. In pre-invasive melanoma in situ5, precise phenotyping shows that adjacent melanocytic cells are plastic in state and participate in tightly localised niches of interferon signalling near sites of initial invasion into the underlying dermis. In this and metastatic melanoma, mature and precursor T cells engage in an unexpectedly diverse array of juxtracrine and membrane-membrane interactions as well as looser ""neighbourhood"" associations6 whose morphologies reveal functional states. These data provide new insight into the transitions occurring during early tumour formation and immunoediting and demonstrate the potential for phenotyping of tissues at a level of detail previously restricted to cultured cells and organoids."	tissue cancer_biology melanoma 3d imaging4 immune multiplexed human microscopy immunofluorescence immunoediting		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2023.11.10.566670.source.xml		Peter Karl Sorger	64	0
Three-dimensional assessments are necessary to determine the true, spatially-resolved composition of tissues	Methods for spatially resolved cellular profiling using thinly cut sections have enabled in-depth quantitative tissue mapping to study inter-sample and intra-sample differences in normal human anatomy and disease onset and progression. These methods often profile extremely limited regions, which may impact the evaluation of heterogeneity due to tissue sub-sampling. Here, we applied CODA, a deep learning-based tissue mapping platform, to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) microanatomy of grossly normal and cancer-containing human pancreas biospecimens obtained from individuals who underwent pancreatic resection. To compare inter-and intra-sample heterogeneity, we assessed bulk and spatially resolved tissue composition in a cohort of two-dimensional (2D) whole slide images (WSIs) and a cohort of thick slabs of pancreas tissue that were digitally reconstructed in 3D from serial sections. To demonstrate the marked under sampling of 2D assessments, we simulated the number of WSIs and tissue microarrays (TMAs) necessary to represent the compositional heterogeneity of 3D data within 10% error to reveal that tens of WSIs and hundreds of TMA cores are sometimes needed. We show that spatial correlation of different pancreatic structures decay significantly within a span of microns, demonstrating that 2D histological sections may not be representative of their neighboring tissues. In sum, we demonstrate that 3D assessments are necessary to accurately assess tissue composition in normal and abnormal specimens and in order to accurately determine neoplastic content. These results emphasize the importance of intra-sample heterogeneity in tissue mapping efforts.	cancer_biology anatomy pancreatic microanatomy pancreas necessary tissues composition cancer spatially assessments		2024-03-28								cc_by_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2023.12.04.569986.source.xml		Denis Wirtz	65	0
Spatial Effects of Infiltrating T cells on Neighbouring Cancer Cells and Prognosis in Stage III CRC patients	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequently occurring cancers, but prognostic biomarkers identifying patients at risk of recurrence are still lacking. In this study, we aimed to investigate in more detail the spatial relationship between intratumoural T cells, cancer cells, and cancer cell hallmarks, as prognostic biomarkers in stage III colorectal cancer patients. We conducted multiplexed imaging of 56 protein markers at single cell resolution on resected fixed tissue from stage III CRC patients who received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Images underwent segmentation for tumour, stroma and immune cells, and cancer cell  state protein marker expression was quantified at a cellular level. We developed a Python package for estimation of spatial proximity, nearest neighbour analysis focusing on cancer cell - T cell interactions at single-cell level. In our discovery cohort (MSK), we processed 462 core samples (total number of cells: 1,669,228) from 221 adjuvant 5FU-treated stage III patients. The validation cohort (HV) consisted of 272 samples (total number of cells: 853,398) from 98 stage III CRC patients. While there were trends for an association between percentage of cytotoxic T cells (across the whole cancer core), it did not reach significance (Discovery cohort: p = 0.07, Validation cohort: p = 0.19). We next utilized our region-based nearest neighbourhood approach to determine the spatial relationships between cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells and cancer cell clusters. In the both cohorts, we found that lower distance between cytotoxic T cells, T helper cells and cancer cells was significantly associated with increased disease-free survival. An unsupervised trained model that clustered patients based on the median distance between immune cells and cancer cells, as well as protein expression profiles, successfully classified patients into low-risk and high-risk groups (Discovery cohort: p = 0.01, Validation cohort: p = 0.003).	cancer_biology biomarkers tumour prognosis cells stage cancers patients chemotherapy cancer		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.01.30.577720.source.xml		Jochen H.

Effect of C-to-T transition at CpG sites on tumor suppressor genes in tumor development in cattle evaluated by somatic mutation analysis in enzootic bovine leukosis	Oncogenic transformation of normal cells is caused by mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in cancer-related genes. Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a malignant B-cell lymphoma caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle. Although a small fraction of BLV-infected cattle develops EBL after a long latent period, the mechanisms for oncogenesis in EBL cattle remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the types and patterns of somatic mutations in cancer cells from 36 EBL cases, targeting 21 cancer-related genes. Various somatic mutations were identified in 8 genes, TP53, NOTCH1, KMT2D, CREBBP, KRAS, PTEN, CARD11, and MYD88. In addition, TP53 gene was found to be mutated in 69.4% of EBL cases, with most being biallelic mutations. In some cases, associations were observed between the ages at which cattle had developed EBL and somatic mutation patterns; young onset of EBL possibly occurs due to congenital mutations, high impact mutations affecting protein translation, and biallelic mutations. Furthermore, nucleotide substitution patterns indicated that cytosine at CpG sites tended to be converted to thymine in many EBL cases, which was considered to be the result of spontaneous deamination of 5-methylctosine. These results demonstrate how somatic mutations have occurred in cancer cells leading to EBL development, thereby explaining its pathogenic mechanism. These findings will contribute to a better understanding and future elucidation of disease progression in BLV infection.  ImportanceEnzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a malignant and lethal disease in cattle. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutic methods against bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, resulting in severe economic losses in livestock industry. This study provides a renewed hypothesis to explain the general mechanisms of EBL onset by combining the previous finding that several integration sites of BLV provirus can affect the increase in survival and proliferation of infected cells. We demonstrate that two additional random events are necessary for oncogenic transformation in infected cell clones, elucidating the reason why only few infected cattle develop EBL. Further exploration of somatic mutation and BLV integration sites could support this hypothesis more firmly, potentially contributing to the development of novel control methods for EBL onset.	cancer_biology genes lymphoma virus cattle leukosis provirus leukemia cancer tumor bovine		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.19.585713.source.xml		Asami Nishimori	67	0
Stochastic variation in the FOXM1 transcription program mediates replication stress tolerance.	Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) is a vulnerability of cancer cells that forces reliance on the intra-S-phase checkpoint to ensure faithful genome duplication. Inhibitors of the crucial intra-S-phase checkpoint kinases ATR and CHK1 have been developed, but persistent proliferation and resistance to these drugs remain problematic. Understanding drug tolerance mechanisms is impeded by analysis of bulk samples, which neglect tumor heterogeneity and often fail to accurately interpret cell cycle-mediated resistance. Here, by combining intracellular immunostaining and RNA-sequencing of single cells, we characterized the transcriptomes of oncogenic RAS-expressing cells that exhibit variable levels of RS when challenged with a CHK1 inhibitor in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. We identified 40 genes differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive cells, including several FOXM1 target genes. While complete knockdown of FOXM1 impeded cell proliferation, a partial knockdown protected cells against DNA damage, and improved recovery from drug-induced RS. Our results suggest that low levels of FOXM1 expression protects subsets of oncogenic RAS-expressing cells against DNA damage during drug-induced replication stress.	cancer_biology stress transcription stochastic dna replication mediates transcriptomes immunostaining cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.26.585806.source.xml		Bart Westendorp	68	0
Fatty acids are not a significant contributor to the TCA cycle in cancer cell lines: evidence of incomplete fatty acid oxidation.	Fatty acid (FA) oxidation (FAO) is upregulated in many cancers, which has been contextualised to thereby be significantly fuel the TCA cycle and generate vast amounts of ATP to support cancer cell viability. However, direct evidence of this is lacking. Here, we set out to determine the capacity of FAO in a pan-cancer setting and if this relates to the amount of carbon FAO contributes to the TCA cycle relative to other substrates. We profiled the baseline FAO rate and capacity of 27 cancer cell lines from 10 tissue origins, and then selected 6 cancer cell lines that represented the diversity of this panel. Despite the diverse range of FAO rates, we consistently found that exogenous long-chain FAs (LCFAs) were a minor (<10%) TCA cycle substrate in all cells compared to glucose and glutamine. Glucose withdrawal significantly increased FAO rates, while glucose and/or glutamine deprivation marginally increased incorporation of 13C-palmitate into TCA cycle metabolites. Palmitate alone modestly assisted cataplerosis but did not sustain TCA cycle fluxes, leading to reduced cell viability. The low contribution of fatty acids to the TCA cycle in cancer cells may be explained by incomplete oxidation of LCFAs of varying chain lengths of saturations to produce shortened acyl-carnitines. Overall, our results provide significant insights into mitochondrial FA metabolism in cultured cancer cells and challenges the belief that the oxidation of FAs is a complete process, contributing significant fuel for the TCA cycle and ATP generation.	cancer_biology upregulated cell oxidation cancers cataplerosis incomplete fatty cancer atp		2024-03-28								cc_by_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586547.source.xml		Andrew J Hoy	69	0
Stable and Oscillatory Hypoxia Differentially Regulate Invasibility of Breast Cancer Associated Fibroblasts	"As local regions in the tumor outstrip their oxygen supply, hypoxia can develop, affecting not only the cancer cells, but also other cells in the microenvironment, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Hypoxia is also not necessarily stable over time, and can fluctuate or oscillate. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 is the master regulator of cellular response to hypoxia, and can also exhibit oscillations in its activity. To understand how stable, and fluctuating hypoxia influence breast CAFs, we measured changes in gene expression in CAFs in normoxia, hypoxia, and oscillatory hypoxia, as well as measured change in their capacity to resist, or assist breast cancer invasion. We show that hypoxia has a profound effect on breast CAFs causing activation of key pathways associated with fibroblast activation, but reduce myofibroblast activation and traction force generation. We also found that oscillatory hypoxia, while expectedly resulted in a ""sub-hypoxic"" response in gene expression, it resulted in specific activation of pathways associated with actin polymerization and actomyosin maturation. Using traction force microscopy, and a nanopatterned stromal invasion assay, we show that oscillatory hypoxia increases contractile force generation vs stable hypoxia, and increases heterogeneity in force generation response, while also additively enhancing invasibility of CAFs to MDA-MB-231 invasion. Our data show that stable and unstable hypoxia can regulate many mechnobiological characteristics of CAFs, and can contribute to transformation of CAFs to assist cancer dissemination and onset of metastasis."	cancer_biology breast hypoxic oscillatory fibroblasts cancer tumor hypoxia		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.26.586706.source.xml		Kshitiz	70	0
Advancing CAR T-Cell Therapy: Simultaneously Attack Tumor and Immunosuppressive Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has encountered limited success in solid tumors. The lack of dependable antigens and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are major challenges. Within the TME, tumor cells along with immunosuppressive cells employ an immune-evasion mechanism that upregulates programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to deactivate effector T cells; this makes PD-L1 a reliable, universal target for solid tumors. We developed a novel PD-L1 CAR (MC9999) using our humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, designed to simultaneously target tumor and immunosuppressive cells. The antigen-specific antitumor effects of MC9999 CAR T-cells were observed consistently across four solid tumor models: breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Notably, intravenous administration of MC9999 CAR T-cells eradicated intracranially established LN229 GBM tumors, suggesting penetration of the blood-brain barrier. The proof-of-concept data demonstrate the cytolytic effect of MC9999 CAR T-cells against immunosuppressive cells, including microglia HMC3 cells and M2 macrophages. Furthermore, MC9999 CAR T-cells elicited cytotoxicity against primary tumor-associated macrophages within GBM tumors. The concept of targeting both tumor and immunosuppressive cells with MC9999 was further validated using CAR T-cells derived from cancer patients. These findings establish MC9999 as a foundation for the development of effective CAR T-cell therapies against solid tumors.	cancer_biology immunosuppressive advancing attack therapy glioblastoma tumors cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586653.source.xml		Hong Qin	71	0
ANP32E drives vulnerability to ATR inhibitors by inducing R-loops-dependent Transcription Replication Conflicts in Triple Negative Breast Cancer	Oncogene-induced replicative stress (RS) plays a central role in tumor progression, leading to genomic instability by eliciting transcription replication conflicts (TRCs), which represent the major source of R-loops, that ultimately favors the onset of the DNA damage response (DDR). We investigated the pathogenic contribution of chromatin factors in increasing TRCs and R-loop frequencies in cancer. We found that in breast cancer patients the concomitant upregulation of MYC and the H2A.Z-specific chaperone ANP32E correlated with an increase genome instability. Genome-wide profiling revealed that the ANP32E-dependent increases turnover of H2A.Z altered RNApol II processivity, leading to accumulation of long R-loops at TRCs. We showed that ANP32E upregulation increases TRCs and activates an ATR-dependent DDR, which predispose cancer cells to R-loop-mediated genomic fragility. By exploiting the vulnerability of ANP32E-expressing cancer cells to ATR inhibitors, we found that tumors relied on this DDR pathway, whose inhibition halted their pro-metastatic capacity.	cancer_biology transcription breast dna anp32e genome tumors inhibitors cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586539.source.xml		alessio Zippo	72	0
Mutational synergy with CREBBP loss in lymphomagenesis identified through forward insertional mutagenesis in a new DLBCL mouse model	Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the acetyltransferase CREBBP have been reported in numerous cancers but are particularly frequent in lymphoid malignancies. However, the functional significance of CREBBP loss in transformation and disease progression, most likely through cooperation with secondary genetic hits, has not yet been fully unravelled. Similarly, the contribution of the initial cell population sustaining CREBBP loss in the course of disease remains elusive. Here, we developed a new lymphoma mouse model integrating Crebbp loss at various stages of B cell development with a transposon-based insertional mutagenesis system. We demonstrated that Crebbp loss from the HSPC compartment resulted in an aggressive DLBCL-like disease, recapitulating well-characterised histological and molecular features of the human disease, as well as the recently described enhanced CD24 expression. More importantly, we identified candidate genes functionally equivalent to patient mutated genes. Those genes, mainly related to B cell development and cellular signalling, may represent novel therapeutic targets. Overall, this new model provides a powerful resource in which to conduct future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.	cancer_biology lymphoma insertional malignancies disease mutagenesis mouse cancers mutational lymphomagenesis lymphoid		2024-03-28								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586554.source.xml		Brian J P Huntly	73	0

Here we demonstrate that HNF4 is upregulated in colorectal cancers. and HNF4 upregulation promotes colorectal tumorigenesis. Notably, expression levels of HNF4 are positively correlated with the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer patients. Further, we showed that HNF4 is transcriptionally activated by Wnt/{beta}-catenin/TCF3 and is at least partially responsible for the oncognesis activity of the Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer.

A 3D in vitro assay to study combined immune cell infiltration and cytotoxicity	"Immune cell-mediated killing of cancer cells in a solid tumor is prefaced by a multi-step infiltration cascade of invasion, directed migration, and cytotoxic activities. In particular, immune cells must invade and migrate through a series of different extracellular matrix (ECM) boundaries and domains before reaching and killing their target tumor cells. These infiltration events are a central challenge to the clinical success of CAR T cells against solid tumors. The current standard in vitro cell killing assays measure cell cytotoxicity in an obstacle-free, two-dimensional (2D) microenvironment, which precludes the study of 3D immune cell-ECM interactions. Here, we present a 3D combined infiltration/cytotoxicity assay based on an oil-in-water microtechnology. This assay measures stromal invasion following extravasation, migration through the stromal matrix, and invasion of the solid tumor in addition to cell killing. We compare this 3D cytotoxicity assay to the benchmark 2D assay through tumor assembloid cocultures with immune cells and engineered immune cells. This assay is amenable to an array of imaging techniques, which allows direct observation and quantification of each stage of infiltration in different immune and oncological contexts. We establish the 3D infiltration/cytotoxicity assay as an important tool for the mechanistic study of immune cell interactions with the tumor microenvironment.

The lipid droplet protein DHRS3 is a regulator of melanoma cell state	Lipid droplets are fat storage organelles composed of a protein envelope and lipid rich core. Regulation of this protein envelope underlies differential lipid droplet formation and function. In melanoma, lipid droplet formation has been linked to tumor progression and metastasis, but it is unknown whether lipid droplet proteins play a role. To address this, we performed proteomic analysis of the lipid droplet envelope in melanoma. We found that lipid droplet proteins were differentially enriched in distinct melanoma states; from melanocytic to undifferentiated. DHRS3, which converts all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol, is upregulated in the MITFLO/undifferentiated/neural crest-like melanoma cell state and reduced in the MITFHI/melanocytic state. Increased DHRS3 expression is sufficient to drive MITFHI/melanocytic cells to a more undifferentiated/invasive state. These changes are due to retinoic acid mediated regulation of melanocytic genes. Our data demonstrate that melanoma cell state can be regulated by expression of lipid droplet proteins which affect downstream retinoid signaling.	cancer_biology melanoma organelles lipid protein cell dhrs3 proteins tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586589.source.xml		Richard M White	76	0
NPRL2 gene therapy induces effective antitumor immunity in KRAS/STK11 mutant anti-PD1 resistant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a humanized mouse model	NPRL2/TUSC4 is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is reduced in many cancers including NSCLC. Restoration of NPRL2 expression in cancer cells induces DNA damage which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We investigated the antitumor immune responses to NPRL2 gene therapy in aPD1R/ KRAS/STK11mt NSCLC in a humanized mouse model. Humanized mice were generated by transplanting fresh human cord blood derived CD34 stem cells into sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice. Lung metastases were developed from KRAS/STK11mt/aPD1R A549 cells in humanized mice and treated with NPRL2 gene-loaded cationic lipid nanoparticles (DOTAP-NPRL2) with or without pembrolizumab (aPD1). NPRL2 treatment reduced lung metastases significantly, whereas pembrolizumab was ineffective. The antitumor effect was greater in humanized than non-humanized mice suggesting that an immune response contributed to antitumor activity. NPRL2 combined with pembrolizumab was not synergistic in the KRAS/STK11mt/aPD1R tumors but was synergistic in the KRASwt/aPD1S H1299 tumors. Consistent with the A549 humanized mouse model, NPRL2 showed a significantly strong antitumor effect on KRASmt/aPD1R LLC2 syngeneic tumors, whereas aPD1 was ineffective. The antitumor effect of NPRL2 was correlated with increased infiltration of human cytotoxic immune cells and Ag-presenting HLA-DR+ DC, CD11c DC, and downregulation of myeloid and regulatory T cells in the TME. The antitumor effect of NPRL2 was significantly abolished upon in-vivo depletion of CD8 T, macrophages, and CD4 T cells. However, the antitumor effect remained unaffected upon in-vivo depletion of NK cells. A distinct pattern of gene expression profile was found in lung met after NPRL2 treatment in humanized mice. The expression of genes associated with T cell functions, including IFN{gamma}, CD8b, CD7, TNFSF18, ITGA1, GATA3, and TBX21 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of genes associated with negative regulation of T cell functions, including FOXP3, TGFB1, TGFB2, and IL-10RA were strongly inhibited upon NPRL2 treatment. NPRL2 downregulated the expression of T cell co-inhibitory molecules, including CTLA4, ICOS, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274, IDO1, PDCD1LG2, CD47, and KLRB1. Tumors established from NPRL2 stably expressing cells in humanized mice exhibited significantly slower growth compared to controls. TME analysis showed an increased presence of human CD45+, CD3+ T, CD8+ T cells, and HLA-DR+ dendritic cells and a decreased percentage of Treg, CD3+PD1+T cells, MDSC, and CD163+ TAM in NPRL2-expressing tumors. In-vitro, NPRL2 stably expressing cells showed a substantial increase in colony formation inhibition and heightened sensitivity to carboplatin in colony formation, apoptosis, and PARP cleavage assays. Stable expression of NPRL2 resulted in the downregulation of MAPK and AKT-mTOR growth signaling through inhibition of pAKT, pmTOR, pPRAS40, p4E-BP1, and pS6 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that NPRL2 gene therapy induces antitumor activity on KRAS/STK11mt/aPD1R tumors through DC-mediated antigen presentation and cytotoxic immune cell activation.	cancer_biology myeloid cancers mouse therapy tumors nprl2 cancer tumor mutant		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.26.586829.source.xml		ISMAIL M MERAZ	77	0
Dual-view jointly learning improves personalized drug synergy prediction	BackgroundAccurate and robust estimation of the synergistic drug combination is important for precision medicine. Although some computational methods have been developed, some predictions are still unreliable especially for the cross-dataset predictions, due to the complex mechanism of drug combinations and heterogeneity of cancer samples.  MethodsWe have proposed JointSyn that utilizes dual-view jointly learning to predict sample-specific effects of drug combination from drug and cell features. JointSyn capture the drug synergy related features from two views. One view is the embedding of drug combination on cancer cell lines, and the other view is the combination of two drugs embeddings on cancer cell lines. Finally, the prediction net uses the features learned from the two views to predict the drug synergy of the drug combination on the cell line. In addition, we used the fine-tuning method to improve the JointSyns performance on the unseen subset within a dataset or cross dataset.  ResultsJointSyn outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and robustness across various benchmarks. Each view of JointSyn captures drug synergy-related characteristics and make complementary contributes to the final accurate prediction of drug combination. Moreover, JointSyn with fine-tuning improves its generalization ability to predict a novel drug combination or cancer sample only using a small number of experimental measurements. We also used JointSyn to generate an estimated atlas of drug synergy for pan-cancer and explored the differential pattern among cancers.  ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the potential of JointSyn to predict drug synergy, supporting the development of personalized combinatorial therapies.

Identifying and targeting key driver genes for collagen production within the 11q13/14 breast cancer amplicon	Genetic studies indicate that breast cancer can be divided into several basic molecular groups. One of these groups, termed IntClust-2, is characterized by amplification of a small portion of chromosome 11 and has a median survival of only five years. Several cancer-relevant genes occupy this portion of chromosome 11, and it is thought that overexpression of a combination of driver genes in this region is responsible for the poor outcome of women in this group. In this study we used a gene editing method to knock out, one by one, each of 198 genes that are located within the amplified region of chromosome 11 and determined how much each of these genes contributed to the survival of breast cancer cells. In addition to well-known drivers such as CCND1 and PAK1, we identified two different genes (SERPINH1 and P4HA3), that encode proteins involved in collagen synthesis and organization. Using both in vitro and in vivo functional analyses, we determined that P4HA3 and/or SERPINH1 provide a critical driver function on IntClust-2 basic processes, such as viability, proliferation, and migration. Inhibiting these enzymes via genetic or pharmacologic means reduced collagen synthesis and impeded oncogenic signaling transduction in cell culture models, and a small-molecule inhibitor of P4HA3 was effective in treating 11q13 tumor growth in an animal model. As collagen has a well-known association with tissue stiffness and aggressive forms of breast cancer, we believe that the two genes we identified provide an opportunity for a new therapeutic strategy in IntClust-2 breast cancers.	cancer_biology genes 14 genetic chromosome breast cancers 11q13 cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.27.587019.source.xml		Jonathan Chernoff	79	0
PTEN and ARID1A haploinsufficiency equip colonic epithelium for oncogenic transformation	Normal aged tissues are thought to exist as a patchwork of mutant clones. However, the relevance of driver mutations in normal tissue in terms of cancer initiation has not been well described. Here, we sought a quantitative understanding of how different cancer drivers achieve an age-related mutational footprint in the human colonic epithelium and to relate the clonal behaviours they generate to cancer risk. Metanalysis of contemporary multiregional sampling studies of colorectal tumours revealed many of the weak or moderate cancer drivers are trunk mutations present in the last common ancestor from which cancers arise. To study the processes by which such driver mutations could contribute to cancer predisposition, immunohistochemistry was used to detect PTEN, SMAD4 and ARID1A deficient clones in normal colon FFPE surgical resection samples (N=182 patients). Age-related changes in clone size and frequency identified positive biases in clone dynamics that acted to increase the mutational footprint for ARID1A and PTEN but not SMAD4. In vitro engineered monoallelic loss of PTEN and ARID1A implicated specific altered downstream pathways and acquired pro-oncogenic cellular fates corresponding to haploinsufficiency for these genes. In situ analysis confirmed enhanced proliferation in both PTEN and ARID1A deficient clones and creation of an immune exclusive microenvironment associated with ARID1A deficiency. The behaviours resulting from haploinsufficiency of PTEN and ARID1A exemplify how priming of the tissue through somatic mosaicism could contribute alternative combinations of genetic events leading to transformation.	epithelium genes haploinsufficiency cancer_biology genetic colonic pten arid1a cancers immunohistochemistry cancer		2024-03-28								cc_by_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.27.586939.source.xml		Douglas J Winton	80	0
A Novel Liver Cancer-Selective Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Is Effective Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Induces Durable Responses with Immunotherapy	"Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) progression is facilitated by gene-silencing chromatin histone hypoacetylation due to histone deacetylases (HDACs) activation. However, inhibiting HDACs -- an effective treatment for lymphomas -- has shown limited success in solid tumors. We report the discovery of a class of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) that demonstrates exquisite selective cytotoxicity against human HCC cells. The lead compound STR-V-53 (3) showed a favorable safety profile in mice and robustly suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of HCC. When combined with the anti-HCC drug sorafenib, STR-V-53 showed greater in vivo efficacy. Moreover, STR-V-53 combined with anti-PD1 therapy increased the CD8+ to regulatory T-cell (Treg) ratio and survival in an orthotopic HCC model in immunocompetent mice. This combination therapy resulted in durable responses in 40% of the mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that STR-V-53 primed HCC cells to immunotherapy through HDAC inhibition, impaired glucose-regulated transcription, impaired DNA synthesis, upregulated apoptosis, and stimulated the immune response pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the novel HDACi STR-V-53 is an effective anti-HCC agent that can induce profound responses when combined with standard immunotherapy.

Hypercholesterolemia-induced impairment in sorafenib functionality is overcome by avasimibe co-treatment	Avasimibe; a cholesterol-lowering drug with a proven safety in clinical trials, has recently been repositioned as an anticancer agent in various preclinical investigations. A study from our group reported that hypercholesterolemia promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell survival and hampers the anticancer effect of sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor. In the present study, we demonstrate that in HCC under hypercholesterolemic conditions the anticancer property of sorafenib is potentiated by avasimibe (AVA) co-treatment. Further, to elucidate the role of hypercholesterolemia on sorafenib efficacy, in vitro and in vivo models of HCC were used. In vitro, co-treatment of both drugs synergistically inhibited HCC cell viability and induced cell death under normal and hypercholesterolemic conditions. At the molecular level, downregulation of ERK signalling and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress are likely to contribute to the combinatorial cytotoxic effect of sorafenib and avasimibe in vitro. In mice, fed on a high-cholesterol diet (HCD), the efficacy of sorafenib was restored by co-administration of AVA. Collectively, these findings suggest that impairment in the efficacy of sorafenib because of hypercholesterolemic phenotype could be restored by AVA co-treatment, which may have implications towards treatment strategy.

Novel synthetic ecteinascidins exhibit potent anti-melanoma activity by suppressing super-enhancer-driven oncogenic transcription	The dynamic cellular transitions exhibited by skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cells present a significant challenge to current therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the critical need for innovative treatments. Lurbinectedin, a marine-derived compound belonging to the ecteinascidin family, has recently gained approval for the treatment of metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of lurbinectedin against SKCM cells, irrespective of their driver mutations or phenotypic states. Additionally, we have developed two novel derivatives of lurbinectedin, termed ecubectedin and PM54, both of which exhibit potent cytotoxic effects on SKCM cells. Moreover, these analogs demonstrate robust anti-tumor activity in melanoma xenograft models, including those resistant to current therapies, leading to prolonged animal survival. Mechanistically, our investigation reveals that these novel synthetic ecteinascidins markedly suppress oncogenic super-enhancer (SE)-mediated gene expression in SKCM cells through a multifaceted mechanism. They bind to and inhibit the activity of promoters of lineage-specific master transcription factors, as well as promoters of genes encoding ubiquitous transcription factors/coactivators, which are highly enriched at oncogenic SEs. These mechanisms likely synergize to disrupt the expression of cancer-promoting genes. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of synthetic ecteinascidins as promising therapeutics for cancers characterized by diverse transcriptional landscapes, particularly in cases where conventional therapeutic options have failed due to the heterogeneity of malignant cell population	cancer_biology melanoma transcription cancers potent therapeutics ecteinascidins enhancer cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.26.586754.source.xml		Frederic Coin	83	0

YTHDC1 m6A-dependent and m6A-independent functions converge to preserve DNA damage response.	Cells have evolved a robust and highly regulated DNA damage response to preserve their genomic integrity. Although increasing evidence highlights the relevance of RNA regulation, our understanding of its impact on a fully efficient DNA damage response remains limited. Here, through a targeted CRISPR-knockout screen, we identified RNA binding proteins and modifiers that participate in mediating the p53 response. Among the top hits, m6A reader YTHDC1 was identified as a master regulator of p53 expression. YTHDC1 binds to the transcription start sites of TP53 and other genes involved in DNA damage response, promoting their transcriptional elongation. YTHDC1 deficiency leads to reduced TP53 expression, and also retention of introns leading to aberrant protein production of key DNA damage factors. While intron retention is dependent on m6A, YTHDC1 favors TP53 transcriptional pause-release independently of m6A. Depletion of YTHDC1 causes genomic instability and aberrant cancer cell proliferation mediated by genes regulated by YTHDC1. Our results uncover YTHDC1 as an orchestrator of the DNA damage response through distinct mechanisms of co-transcriptional mRNA regulation.	cancer_biology genes rna cancer dna mrna functions m6a ythdc1 converge		2024-03-28								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586632.source.xml		Maite Huarte	85	0
Androgen deprivation therapy-resistant club cells are linked to myeloid cell-driven immunosuppression in the prostate tumor microenvironment	Prostate cancer treatment resistance is a significant challenge facing the field. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling have partially elucidated the mechanisms through which cancer cells escape treatment, but their relation toward the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of the prostate TME at multiple points in the standard treatment timeline employing single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from 110 patients. We identify club-like cells as a key epithelial cell subtype that acts as an interface between the prostate and the immune system. Tissue areas enriched with club-like cells have depleted androgen signaling and upregulated expression of luminal progenitor cell markers. Club-like cells display a senescence-associated secretory phenotype and their presence is linked to increased polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) activity. Our results indicate that club-like cells partake in inducing myeloid inflammation previously associated with androgen deprivation therapy resistance, providing a rationale for their therapeutic targeting.	cancer_biology myeloid immunosuppression androgen prostate transcriptomics cancer tumor		2024-03-28								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.25.586330.source.xml		Matti Nykter	86	0
CPT1A Mediates Radiation Sensitivity in Colorectal Cancer	The prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) are increasing worldwide. Radiation resistance hinders radiotherapy, a standard treatment for advanced CRC, leading to local recurrence and metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance in CRC is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Bioinformatic analysis and tumour tissue examination were conducted to investigate the CPT1A mRNA and protein levels in CRC and their correlation with radiotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors, along with in vitro and in vivo radiation experiments, were used to explore the effect of CPT1A on radiosensitivity. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing, molecular biology experiments, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CPT1A regulates radiosensitivity. CPT1A was significantly downregulated in CRC and negatively correlated with responsiveness to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Functional studies suggested that CPT1A mediates radiosensitivity, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA damage response. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses highlighted the involvement of the peroxisomal pathway. Mechanistic exploration revealed that CPT1A downregulates the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis, moderating cellular ROS levels after irradiation and enhancing radiosensitivity. CPT1A downregulation contributes to radioresistance in CRC by augmenting the FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, CPT1A is a potential biomarker of radiosensitivity and a novel target for overcoming radioresistance, offering a future direction to enhance CRC radiotherapy.	cancer_biology overexpression colorectal radiation tumour cpt1a radiotherapy sensitivity biomarker cancer		2024-03-28								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/28/2024.03.26.586752.source.xml		Yi Ding	87	0
MAP4 kinase-regulated reduced CLSTN1 expression in medulloblastoma is associated with increased invasiveness	De-regulated protein expression contributes to tumor growth and progression in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. MB is associated with impaired differentiation of specific neural progenitors, suggesting that the deregulation of proteins involved in neural physiology could contribute to the transformed phenotype in MB.  Calsynthenin 1 (CLSTN1) is a neuronal protein involved in cell-cell interaction, vesicle trafficking, and synaptic signaling. We previously identified CLSTN1 as a putative target of the pro-invasive kinase MAP4K4, which we found to reduce CLSTN1 surface expression. Herein, we explored the expression and functional significance of CLSTN1 in MB. We found that CLSTN1 expression is decreased in primary MB tumors compared to tumor-free cerebellum or brain tissues. CLSTN1 is expressed in laboratory-established MB cell lines, where it localized to the plasma membrane, intracellular vesicular structures, and regions of cell-cell contact. The reduction of CLSTN1 expression significantly increased growth factor-driven invasiveness. Pharmacological inhibition of MAP4 kinases caused increased CLSTN1 expression and CLSTN1 accumulation in cell-cell contacts. Co-culture of tumor cells with astrocytes increased CLSTN1 localization in cell-cell contacts, which was further enhanced by MAP4K inhibition.  Our study revealed a repressive function of CLSTN1 in growth-factor-driven invasiveness in MB and its potential implication in homologous and heterologous interactions of the tumor cells with cells in their microenvironment.	cancer_biology medulloblastoma clstn1 map4 kinase invasiveness astrocytes tumors tumor map4k4		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585872.source.xml		Martin Baumgartner	88	0
Cancer-Associated Hypercalcemia Signals Through the Hindbrain to cause Anorexia	Hypercalcemia, caused by tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), is associated with anorexia and weight loss. We demonstrate that overexpression of PTHrP by tumor cells in a transgenic model of breast cancer causes anorexia and rapid weight loss. These changes are accompanied by activation of neurons in the area postrema (AP), the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), a hindbrain circuit regulating food intake. Blocking hypercalcemia prevents anorexia and activation of these brain centers in tumor bearing mice, whereas injecting calcium activates the same circuit in wild-type mice. Neurons in the AP express the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and the same AP/NTS/PBN circuit is stimulated by treating WT mice with cinacalcet, an allosteric activator of the CaSR. Finally, treating diet-induced obese mice with cinacalcet reduces food intake and causes weight loss. These results suggest that CaSR-expressing neurons in the AP might be a pharmacologic target for obesity.	cancer_biology overexpression hypercalcemia anorexia obesity signals hindbrain cancer tumor		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.19.585694.source.xml		John J.

Effect of C-to-T transition at CpG sites on tumor suppressor genes in tumor development in cattle evaluated by somatic mutation analysis in enzootic bovine leukosis	Oncogenic transformation of normal cells is caused by mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in cancer-related genes. Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a malignant B-cell lymphoma caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle. Although a small fraction of BLV-infected cattle develops EBL after a long latent period, the mechanisms for oncogenesis in EBL cattle remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the types and patterns of somatic mutations in cancer cells from 36 EBL cases, targeting 21 cancer-related genes. Various somatic mutations were identified in 8 genes, TP53, NOTCH1, KMT2D, CREBBP, KRAS, PTEN, CARD11, and MYD88. In addition, TP53 gene was found to be mutated in 69.4% of EBL cases, with most being biallelic mutations. In some cases, associations were observed between the ages at which cattle had developed EBL and somatic mutation patterns; young onset of EBL possibly occurs due to congenital mutations, high impact mutations affecting protein translation, and biallelic mutations. Furthermore, nucleotide substitution patterns indicated that cytosine at CpG sites tended to be converted to thymine in many EBL cases, which was considered to be the result of spontaneous deamination of 5-methylctosine. These results demonstrate how somatic mutations have occurred in cancer cells leading to EBL development, thereby explaining its pathogenic mechanism. These findings will contribute to a better understanding and future elucidation of disease progression in BLV infection.  ImportanceEnzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a malignant and lethal disease in cattle. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutic methods against bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, resulting in severe economic losses in livestock industry. This study provides a renewed hypothesis to explain the general mechanisms of EBL onset by combining the previous finding that several integration sites of BLV provirus can affect the increase in survival and proliferation of infected cells. We demonstrate that two additional random events are necessary for oncogenic transformation in infected cell clones, elucidating the reason why only few infected cattle develop EBL. Further exploration of somatic mutation and BLV integration sites could support this hypothesis more firmly, potentially contributing to the development of novel control methods for EBL onset.	cancer_biology genes lymphoma virus cattle leukosis provirus leukemia cancer tumor bovine		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.19.585713.source.xml		Asami Nishimori	90	0
Systematic annotation of orphan RNAs reveals blood-accessible molecular barcodes of cancer identity and cancer-emergent oncogenic drivers	From extrachromosomal DNA to neo-peptides, the broad reprogramming of the cancer genome leads to the emergence of molecules that are specific to the cancer state. We recently described orphan non-coding RNAs (oncRNAs) as a class of cancer-specific small RNAs with the potential to play functional roles in breast cancer progression1. Here, we report a systematic and comprehensive search to identify, annotate, and characterize cancer-emergent oncRNAs across 32 tumor types. We also leverage large-scale in vivo genetic screens in xenografted mice to functionally identify driver oncRNAs in multiple tumor types. We have not only discovered a large repertoire of oncRNAs, but also found that their presence and absence represent a digital molecular barcode that faithfully captures the types and subtypes of cancer. Importantly, we discovered that this molecular barcode is partially accessible from the cell-free space as some oncRNAs are secreted by cancer cells. In a large retrospective study across 192 breast cancer patients, we showed that oncRNAs can be reliably detected in the blood and that changes in the cell-free oncRNA burden captures both short-term and long-term clinical outcomes upon completion of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Together, our findings establish oncRNAs as an emergent class of cancer-specific non-coding RNAs with potential roles in tumor progression and clinical utility in liquid biopsies and disease monitoring.	cancer_biology biopsies molecular rnas dna barcodes annotation cancer tumor chemotherapy		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.19.585748.source.xml		Hani Goodarzi	91	0
Illuminating the Dark Cancer Phosphoproteome Through a Machine-Learned Co-Regulation Map of 26,280 Phosphosites	Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics offers a comprehensive view of protein phosphorylation, but limited knowledge about the regulation and function of most phosphosites restricts our ability to extract meaningful biological insights from phosphoproteomics data. To address this, we combine machine learning and phosphoproteomic data from 1,195 tumor specimens spanning 11 cancer types to construct CoPheeMap, a network mapping the co-regulation of 26,280 phosphosites. Integrating network features from CoPheeMap into a machine learning model, CoPheeKSA, we achieve superior performance in predicting kinase-substrate associations. CoPheeKSA reveals 24,015 associations between 9,399 phosphosites and 104 serine/threonine kinases, including many unannotated phosphosites and under-studied kinases. We validate the accuracy of these predictions using experimentally determined kinase-substrate specificities. By applying CoPheeMap and CoPheeKSA to phosphosites with high computationally predicted functional significance and cancer-associated phosphosites, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools in systematically illuminating phosphosites of interest, revealing dysregulated signaling processes in human cancer, and identifying under-studied kinases as putative therapeutic targets.	cancer_biology 280 phosphosites spectrometry kinases phosphoproteomics 26 phosphoproteome cancer tumor		2024-03-21								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.19.585786.source.xml		Bing Zhang	92	0
CDK12 Loss Promotes Prostate Cancer Development While Exposing Vulnerabilities to Paralog-Based Synthetic Lethality	Biallelic loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) defines a unique molecular subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It remains unclear, however, whether CDK12 loss per se is sufficient to drive prostate cancer development--either alone, or in the context of other genetic alterations--and whether CDK12-mutant tumors exhibit sensitivity to specific pharmacotherapies. Here, we demonstrate that tissue-specific Cdk12 ablation is sufficient to induce preneoplastic lesions and robust T cell infiltration in the mouse prostate. Allograft-based CRISPR screening demonstrated that Cdk12 loss is positively associated with Trp53 inactivation but negatively associated with Pten inactivation--akin to what is observed in human mCRPC. Consistent with this, ablation of Cdk12 in prostate organoids with concurrent Trp53 loss promotes their proliferation and ability to form tumors in mice, while Cdk12 knockout in the Pten-null prostate cancer mouse model abrogates tumor growth. Bigenic Cdk12 and Trp53 loss allografts represent a new syngeneic model for the study of androgen receptor (AR)-positive, luminal prostate cancer. Notably, Cdk12/Trp53 loss prostate tumors are sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. Cdk12-null organoids (either with or without Trp53 co-ablation) and patient-derived xenografts from tumors with CDK12 inactivation are highly sensitive to inhibition or degradation of its paralog kinase, CDK13. Together, these data identify CDK12 as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene with impact on tumor progression and lends support to paralog-based synthetic lethality as a promising strategy for treating CDK12-mutant mCRPC.	cancer_biology cdk12 cancer paralog prostate tumors lethality tumor		2024-03-21								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585990.source.xml		Arul M.

Consequences of platelet-educated cancer cells on the expression of inflammatory and metastatic glycoproteins.	Cancer-associated thrombosis, a major cause of mortality in cancer patients, exhibits a 4 to 7 times higher incidence compared to the general population. Platelet activation by tumor cells contributes to this pro-thrombotic state. Cancer cell-educated platelets have also been described to be implicated in promoting metastasis. Intriguingly, our team, among others, unveils a reverse process, wherein platelets educate cancer cells by transferring lipids, RNAs, and proteins. Here, focusing on colorectal and pancreatic cancers, our study investigates genes and proteins mediating platelet education of cancer cells. We demonstrated, for the first time, that platelets can educate cancer cells by inducing changes in the transcription of genes related to glycosylation, inflammation, and metastasis in cancer cells themselves. These results indicate a direct impact of platelets on cancer cell phenotype. This novel insight suggests potential therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment, disrupting platelet-mediated alterations and influencing the course of cancer progression.	glycoproteins cancer_biology platelet cancers cells thrombosis thrombotic metastatic cancer tumor		2024-03-21								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585903.source.xml		Christophe Dubois	94	0
Targeting Diffuse Midline Glioma with a novel anti-CD99 Antibody	Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are devastating brain tumors that occur primarily in children. The salient feature of these tumors is the presence of a H3K27M mutation (K27M), associated with the worst prognosis. We identified the cell surface antigen CD99 as notably expressed in DMGs, particularly in K27M+DMGs. We found that the increased expression of CD99 in K27M+DMGs was a result of the onco-histone K27M mutation. In K27M+DMG cells, CD99 inactivation impaired tumor growth by inducing cell differentiation, indicating an oncogenic role of CD99 enabled by blocking differentiation. We then developed a novel therapeutic anti-CD99 chimeric antibody, 10D1, with a membrane-proximal binding epitope, and evaluated its antitumor efficacy in preclinical models of K27M+DMG. 10D1 suppressed DMG growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis. When combined with radiation treatment, 10D1 exhibited improved antitumor efficiency and xenograft survival, providing a strong justification for its clinical development as a therapy for DMGs.  Statement of SignificanceThis study emphasizes that CD99 overexpression occurs due to the H3K27M mutation in Diffuse Midline Gliomas (DMGs). This heightened expression suppresses apoptosis, inhibits differentiation, and induces radio-resistance in DMGs. This research justifies using a novel CD99 antibody alone or combined with radiation therapy in human pediatric clinical trials.	cancer_biology overexpression antibody h3k27m cd99 apoptosis glioma targeting novel tumors tumor		2024-03-21								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.19.585814.source.xml		Sujatha Venkataraman	95	0
BET inhibition induces GDH1-dependent glutamine metabolic remodeling and vulnerability in liver cancer	Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins, which function partly through MYC, are critical epigenetic readers and emerging therapeutic targets in cancer. Whether and how BET inhibition simultaneously induces metabolic remodeling remains unclear. Here we find that even transient BET inhibition by JQ-1 and other pan-BET inhibitors blunts liver cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. BET inhibition decreases glycolytic gene expression but enhances mitochondrial glucose and glutamine oxidative metabolism revealed by metabolomics and isotope labeling analysis. Specifically, BET inhibition downregulates miR-30a to upregulate glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) independent of MYC, which produces -ketoglutarate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Targeting GDH1 or OXPHOS is synthetic lethal to BET inhibiton, and combined BET and OXPHOS inhibition therapeutically prevents liver tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, we uncover an important epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk whereby BET inhibition induces MYC- independent and GDH1-dependendent glutamine metabolic remodeling that can be exploited for innovative combination therapy of liver cancer.	metabolic cancer_biology glutamine remodeling therapy liver cancer tumor glycolytic		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585859.source.xml		Fuming Li	96	0
UDP-6-glucose dehydrogenase in hormonally responsive breast cancers	Survival for metastatic breast cancer is low and thus, continued efforts to treat and prevent metastatic progression are critical. Estrogen is shown to promote aggressive phenotypes in multiple cancer models irrespective of estrogen receptor (ER) status. Similarly, UDP-Glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) a ubiquitously expressed enzyme involved in extracellular matrix precursors, as well as hormone processing increases migratory and invasive properties in cancer models. While the role of UGDH in cellular migration is defined, how it intersects with and impacts hormone signaling pathways associated with tumor progression in metastatic breast cancer has not been explored. Here we demonstrate that UGDH knockdown blunts estrogen-induced tumorigenic phenotypes (migration and colony formation) in ER+ and ER- breast cancer in vitro. Knockdown of UGDH also inhibits extravasation of ER- breast cancer ex vivo, primary tumor growth and animal survival in vivo in both ER+ and ER- breast cancer. We also use single cell RNA-sequencing to demonstrate that our findings translate to a human breast cancer clinical specimen. Our findings support the role of estrogen and UGDH in breast cancer progression provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the role of UGDH in therapeutic resistance to improve outcomes and survival for breast cancer patients.	cancer_biology udp breast tumor tumorigenic cancers invasive dehydrogenase cancer glucose		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585919.source.xml		C.

How clinically relevant are prostate cancer cell lines? A comprehensive characterisation and multiomics comparison.	Cell line experiments arguably remain the most used tool in preclinical cancer research, despite their limitations. With almost 95% drugs entering human trials failing, and up to 90% preclinical research failing before even being tested in humans, we must shift the pre-clinical paradigm. A range of in silico, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo approaches are gaining popularity, with the aim of potentially replacing cell line use. However, we cannot ignore the plethora of historical data from cell lines, nor write off their future use- especially within advanced bioengineered models. Therefore, we must question if and how cell lines hold clinical relevance. This study evaluates the clinical characteristics of 46 prostate cancer cell lines against worldwide data and investigates the biological features of seven cell lines in depth, comparing them to over 10,000 well characterised human cases from 24 studies in nine countries. Clinical features compared included age, ethnicity, Gleason grade, cancer type, treatment history and multiomics variables included mutations, copy number alterations, structural variants, microsatellite instability, mRNA and protein expression, and tumour mutational burden. We found that the most used cell lines accurately represent a minute proportion of prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we recommend a pipeline for tailoring selection of clinically relevant cell lines with the ultimate aim of increasing the scientific methodology behind choosing a cell line.	cancer_biology tumour cell 90 prostate clinically multiomics bioengineered cancer		2024-03-21								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585982.source.xml		Zahra Ahmed	98	0
Ether lipids influence cancer cell fate by modulating iron uptake	Cancer cell fate has been widely ascribed to mutational changes within protein-coding genes associated with tumor suppressors and oncogenes. In contrast, the mechanisms through which the biophysical properties of membrane lipids influence cancer cell survival, dedifferentiation and metastasis have received little scrutiny. Here, we report that cancer cells endowed with a high metastatic ability and cancer stem cell-like traits employ ether lipids to maintain low membrane tension and high membrane fluidity. Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays, we show that these ether lipid-regulated biophysical properties permit non-clathrin-mediated iron endocytosis via CD44, leading directly to significant increases in intracellular redox-active iron and enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Using a combination of in vitro three-dimensional microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models, we show that loss of ether lipids also strongly attenuates extravasation, metastatic burden and cancer stemness. These findings illuminate a mechanism whereby ether lipids in carcinoma cells serve as key regulators of malignant progression while conferring a unique vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.	iron genes cancer_biology genetic cancer ether cell carcinoma lipids tumor		2024-03-21								cc_by_nc_nd		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.585922.source.xml		Robert A Weinberg	99	0
Single-cell profiling reveals the intratumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment in cervical adenocarcinoma	BackgroundCervical adenocarcinoma (ADC) is more aggressive compared to other types of cervical cancer (CC), such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor heterogeneity are recognized as pivotal factors in cancer progression and therapy. However, the disparities in TIME and heterogeneity between ADC and SCC are poorly understood.  MethodsWe performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 11 samples of ADC tumor tissues, with other 4 SCC samples served as controls. The immunochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence were conducted to validate our findings.  ResultsCompared to SCC, ADC exhibited unique enrichments in several sub-clusters of epithelial cells with elevated stemness and hyper-malignant features, including the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster. ADC displayed a highly immunosuppressive environment characterized by the enrichment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-promoting neutrophils. The Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster recruits Tregs via ALCAM-CD6 signaling, while Tregs reciprocally induce stemness in the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster through TGF{beta} signaling. Importantly, our study revealed that the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster could serve as a valuable predictor of lymph node metastasis for CC patients.  ConclusionsThis study highlights the significance of ADC-specific cell clusters in establishing a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately contributing to the heightened aggressiveness and poorer prognosis of ADC compared to SCC.	cancer_biology microenvironment immunosuppressive cervical adenocarcinoma carcinoma intratumor cancer tumor		2024-03-21								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/21/2024.03.20.586024.source.xml		Liang Weng	100	0
CDK4 and CDK6 upregulation promotes DNA replication stress, genomic instability and resistance to EGFR targeted therapy in lung cancer	Genetic interactions impact both normal human physiology and human diseases, such as cancer. Here, we study genetic interactions through the lens of human lung cancers driven by oncogenic forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which we and others previously showed harbor a rich landscape of genetic co-alterations and potential genetic interactions. Among the most common genetic co-alterations with oncogenic EGFR are genomic amplifications of cell cycle regulators CDK4 or CDK6, which have been implicated in EGFR inhibitor clinical resistance, although the mechanism underlying this effect is not well characterized. We show that CDK4/6 upregulation overcomes EGFR inhibitor-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in association with increased replication stress, DNA damage and genomic instability. These biological effects arising in CDK4/6 upregulated tumors help to enable resistance to EGFR targeted therapies through established genetic resistance mechanisms. Combinatorial EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment alleviated genomic instability and EGFR inhibitor resistance in patient-derived preclinical models. This study reveals mechanistic and clinical impacts of the genetic interaction between oncogenic EGFR and CDK4/6 co-alterations in human lung cancer.	cancer_biology genetic lung dna cancers therapy tumors cancer cdk4		2024-03-14								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/14/2024.03.12.584638.source.xml		Collin M.

Proteomic Analysis Reveals Trilaciclib-Induced Senescence	"Trilaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, was approved as a myeloprotective agent for protecting bone marrow from chemotherapy-induced damage in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). This is achieved through the induction of a temporary halt in the cell cycle of bone marrow cells. While it has been studied in various cancer types, its potential in haematological cancers remains unexplored. This research aimed to investigate the efficacy of trilaciclib in haematological cancers. Utilizing mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we examined the alterations induced by trilaciclib in the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cell line, K562. Interestingly, trilaciclib promoted senescence in these cells rather than cell death, as observed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and myeloma cells. In K562 cells, trilaciclib hindered cell cycle progression and proliferation by stabilising CDK4/6 and downregulating cell cycle-related proteins, along with the concomitant activation of autophagy pathways. Additionally, trilaciclib-induced senescence was also observed in the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NSCLC), A549. These findings highlight trilaciclibs potential as a therapeutic option for haematological cancers and underscore the need to carefully balance senescence induction and autophagy modulation in CML treatment, as well as in NSCLC.

Assessing Long-Term Stored Tissues for Multi-Omics Data Quality and Proteogenomics Suitability	As research into the complexities of cancer biology deepens, the integration of multi-omics analyses has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complex molecular basis of cancers. However, challenges related to sample availability, including size, collection procedures, and storage duration, hinder the broad application of this methodology. Despite these limitations, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of archived samples to expand the scope of multi-omics research. Our study aims to investigate the impact of storage duration on the measurment in genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles of archived samples, demonstrating their viability for advancing our understanding of cancer biology. To comprehensively address these trends and limitations, we systematically examined archived samples collected over a decade, focusing on their transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic attributes. Analysis revealed intricate patterns and dynamic shifts, especially in long-term transcriptomic data, with observed declines in read counts related to protein coding and gene coverage. However, these changes did not compromise the fundamental gene expression landscape. Proteomic result also demonstrated that storage period did not significantly influence proteomic measurement. Comparisons of housekeeping gene (HKG) and housekeeping protein (HKP) expressions unveiled consistent transcriptomic levels across samples, while distinctive proteomic disparities between tumor and normal tissues. In conclusion, the challenges posed by limited sample availability in multi-omics studies can be partially overcome through the strategic integration of archived samples. While technical shifts were evident in certain aspects of transcriptomic data, core gene expression patterns remained robust, and the functionality of essential transcription factors (TFs) and kinases remained unaffected. These findings underscore the potential of archived samples as valuable resources for multi-omics research, providing a broader landscape for investigating cancer biology and paving the way for more comprehensive insights into this intricate field.	cancer_biology transcriptomic suitability proteogenomics cancers assessing tissues stored cancer tumor biology		2024-03-14								cc_no		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/14/2024.03.13.583805.source.xml		Kwang Pyo Kim	103	0
Deciphering molecular mechanisms of synergistic growth reduction in kinase inhibitor combinations	In cancer treatment, the persistent challenge of unresponsiveness of certain patients to drugs or the development of resistance post-treatment remains a significant concern. Drug combinations that synergistically reduce tumor growth emerge as a promising avenue to address this issue. Here, we aimed to characterize the mechanism of action of two synergistic drug combinations that target PI3K together with MEK1 or with TAK1 and used time course measurements of phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics in response to single inhibitors and their combinations. Our analysis untangled those responses driven by single drugs and responses that were unique to the combinations. We observed a high overlap between single-drug responses and their combinations, suggesting that single-drug mechanisms dominate the mechanism of action of the combinations of the kinase inhibitors. Despite a high overlap, both drug combinations exhibited a synergistic modulation of several cell fate regulators found at the convergence points of the targeted pathways, including the key regulator of intrinsic apoptosis BCL2L11. Interestingly, the responses in both combinations were largely limited to the targeted pathways, namely PI3K/AKT and MAPKs, with very limited change of any other additional cell fate decision pathways. In addition, we observed a strong downregulation of nucleotide metabolism and tRNA biosynthesis uniquely in the combinations, which could be attributed to the reduced activity of mTOR and ATF4. Our approach provides insights into the molecular mechanisms affected by the PI3Ki-TAK1i and PI3Ki-MEKi combinations and can serve as a flexible framework for dissecting drug combination responses based on multi-omics measurements.	cancer_biology deciphering molecular reduction biosynthesis apoptosis kinase inhibitor transcriptomics cancer tumor		2024-03-14								cc_by		https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/14/2024.03.12.584561.source.xml		Eirini Tsirvouli	104	0
